(This functionality can be turned off with the parameter StorageVirtualDischarge in the GenX settings file.) These represent power that the storage device could  \thave discharged or consumed if called upon to do so, based on its available state of charge. Importantly, a dedicated set of variables (those of the form Pi^CRM_ozt Theta^CRM_ozt)  \tand constraints are created to ensure that any virtual contributions to the capacity reserve margin could be made as actual charge/discharge if necessary without  \taffecting system operations in any other timesteps. If a capacity reserve margin is not modeled, all related variables are fixed at 0. The overall contribution  \tof storage devices to the system's capacity reserve margin in timestep t is equal to sum_y in mathcalO epsilon_yzp^CRM times left(Theta_yzt + Theta^CRM_ozt - Pi^CRM_ozt - Pi_yzt right),  \tand includes both actual and virtual charge and discharge.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt + Theta_ozt + Theta^CRM_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nStorage with symmetric charge and discharge capacity For storage technologies with symmetric charge and discharge capacity (all o in mathcalO^sym), charge rate, Pi_ozt, and virtual charge rate, Pi^CRM_ozt, are jointly constrained by the total installed power capacity, Omega_oz. Since storage resources generally represent a `cluster' of multiple similar storage devices of the same type/cost in the same zone, GenX permits storage resources to simultaneously charge and discharge (as some units could be charging while others discharge), with the simultaenous sum of charge, Pi_ozt, discharge, Theta_ozt, virtual charge, Pi^CRM_ozt, and virtual discharge, Theta^CRM_ozt, also limited by the total installed power capacity, Delta^total_oz. These two constraints are as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt + Theta_ozt + Theta^CRM_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_symmetric!() in storage_symmetric.jl. If reserves are modeled, the following two constraints replace those above:\n\nbeginaligned\n  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt + f^charge_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt + f^charge_ozt + Theta_ozt + Theta^CRM_ozt + f^discharge_ozt + r^discharge_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \nendaligned\n\nwhere f^charge_ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging, f^discharge_ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while discharging, and r^discharge_ozt is the contribution of storage resources to upward reserves while discharging. Note that as storage resources can contribute to regulation and reserves while either charging or discharging, the proxy variables f^charge_ozt f^discharge_ozt and r^charge_ozt r^discharge_ozt are created for storage resources where the total contribution to regulation and reserves, f_ozt r_ozt is the sum of the proxy variables. These constraints are created with the function storage_symmetric_operational_reserves!() in storage_symmetric.jl. Storage with asymmetric charge and discharge capacity For storage technologies with asymmetric charge and discharge capacities (all o in mathcalO^asym), charge rate, Pi_ozt, is constrained by the total installed charge capacity, Delta^total charge_oz, as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt leq Delta^total charge_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^asym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_asymmetric() in storage_asymmetric.jl. If reserves are modeled, the above constraint is replaced by the following:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt + f^charge_ozt leq Delta^total charge_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^asym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere f^+_y=ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging. These constraints are created with the function storage_symmetric_operational_reserves!() in storage_asymmetric.jl. All storage resources The following constraints apply to all storage resources, o in mathcalO, regardless of whether the charge/discharge capacities are symmetric or asymmetric. The following two constraints track the state of charge of the storage resources at the end of each time period, relating the volume of energy stored at the end of the time period, Gamma_ozt, to the state of charge at the end of the prior time period, Gamma_ozt-1, the charge and discharge decisions in the current time period, Pi_ozt Theta_ozt, and the self discharge rate for the storage resource (if any), eta_oz^loss.  The first of these two constraints enforces storage inventory balance for interior time steps (t in mathcalT^interior), while the second enforces storage balance constraint for the initial time step (t in mathcalT^start).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt =Gamma_ozt-1 - frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_ozt + eta_oz^chargePi_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior\n\t  Gamma_ozt =Gamma_ozt+tau^period-1 - frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_ozt + eta_oz^chargePi_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma_ozt+tau^period-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nIf a capacity reserve margin is modeled, then the following constraints track the relationship between the virtual charge, Pi^CRM_ozt, and virtual discharge, Theta^CRM_ozt, variables and a third variable, Gamma^CRM_ozt, representing the amount of state of charge that must be held in reserve to enable these virtual capacity reserve margin contributions, ensuring that the storage device could deliver its pledged capacity if called upon to do so without affecting its operations in other timesteps. Gamma^CRM_ozt is tracked similarly to the devices overall state of charge based on its value in the previous timestep and the virtual charge and discharge in the current timestep. Unlike the regular state of charge, virtual discharge Theta^CRM_ozt increases Gamma^CRM_ozt (as more charge must be held in reserve to support more virtual discharge), and Pi^CRM_ozt reduces Gamma^CRM_ozt.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma^CRM_ozt =Gamma^CRM_ozt-1 + frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta^CRM_ozt - eta_oz^chargePi^CRM_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma^CRM_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior\n\t  Gamma^CRM_ozt =Gamma^CRM_ozt+tau^period-1 + frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta^CRM_ozt - eta_oz^chargePi^CRM_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma^CRM_ozt+tau^period-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nThe energy held in reserve, Gamma^CRM_ozt, also acts as a lower bound on the overall state of charge Gamma_ozt. This ensures that the storage device cannot use state of charge that would not have been available had it been called on to actually contribute its pledged virtual discharge at some earlier timestep. This relationship is described by the following equation:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt geq Gamma^CRM_ozt \nendaligned\n\nWhen modeling the entire year as a single chronological period with total number of time steps of tau^period, storage inventory in the first time step is linked to storage inventory at the last time step of the period representing the year. Alternatively, when modeling the entire year with multiple representative periods, this constraint relates storage inventory in the first timestep of the representative period with the inventory at the last time step of the representative period, where each representative period is made of tau^period time steps. In this implementation, energy exchange between representative periods is not permitted. When modeling representative time periods, GenX enables modeling of long duration energy storage which tracks state of charge (and state of charge held in reserve, if a capacity reserve margin is being modeled) between representative periods enable energy to be moved throughout the year. If there is more than one representative period and LDS has been enabled for resources in Generators.csv, this function calls long_duration_storage() in long_duration_storage.jl to enable this feature. The next constraint limits the volume of energy stored at any time, Gamma_ozt, to be less than the installed energy storage capacity, Delta^total energy_oz. Finally, the maximum combined discharge and virtual discharge rate for storage resources, Pi_ozt + Pi^CRM_ozt, is constrained to be less than the discharge power capacity, Omega_ozt or the state of charge at the end of the last period, Gamma_ozt-1, whichever is less.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt leq Delta^total energy_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt + Theta^CRM_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt + Theta^CRM_ozt leq Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe above constraints are established in storage_all!() in storage_all.jl. If reserves are modeled, two pairs of proxy variables f^charge_ozt f^discharge_ozt and r^charge_ozt r^discharge_ozt are created for storage resources, to denote the contribution of storage resources to regulation or reserves while charging or discharging, respectively. The total contribution to regulation and reserves, f_ozt r_ozt is then the sum of the proxy variables:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  f_ozt = f^charge_ozt + f^dicharge_ozt  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  r_ozt = r^charge_ozt + r^dicharge_ozt  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe total storage contribution to frequency regulation (f_ozt) and reserves (r_ozt) are each limited specified fraction of installed discharge power capacity (upsilon^reg_yz upsilon^rsv_yz), reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the storage resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tf_yzt leq upsilon^reg_yz times Delta^total_yz\n\thspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n\tr_yz t leq upsilon^rsv_yztimes Delta^total_yz\n\thspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\tendaligned\n\nWhen charging, reducing the charge rate is contributing to upwards reserve and frequency regulation as it drops net demand.

The solution of this multi-stage problem relies on exploiting the decomposable nature of the multi-stage problem via the implementation of the dual dynamic programming algorithm, described in Lara et al. 2018 here. This algorithm splits up a multi-stage investment planning problem into multiple, single-period sub-problems. Each period is solved iteratively as a separate linear program sub-problem (“forward pass”), and information from future periods is shared with past periods (“backwards pass”) so that investment decisions made in subsequent iterations reflect the contributions of present-day investments to future costs. The decomposition algorithm adapts previous nested Benders methods by handling integer and continuous state variables, although at the expense of losing its finite convergence property due to potential duality gap.\nThe user can formulate a sequential, myopic multi-stage planning problem, where the model solves a sequence of single-stage investment planning problems wherein investment decisions in each stage are individually optimized to meet demand given assumptions for the current planning stage and with investment decisions from previous stages treated as inputs for the current stage. We refer to this as \"myopic\" (or shortsighted) mode since the solution does not account for information about future stages in determining investments for a given stage. This version is generally more computationally efficient than the deterministic multi-stage expansion with perfect foresight mode.","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Reference/Multi_Stage/multi_stage_overview/","page":"Multi-Stage Modeling Introduction","title":"Multi-Stage Modeling Introduction","text":"More information on this feature can be found in the section Multi-stage setup.","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Reference/write_outputs/#Functions-for-Writing-the-Different-Results/Outputs-to-Separate-Files","page":"Outputs Functions","title":"Functions for Writing the Different Results/Outputs to Separate Files","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Model_Reference/write_outputs/","page":"Outputs Functions","title":"Outputs Functions","text":"Modules = [GenX]\nPages = [\"write_outputs.jl\", \"choose_output_dir.jl\", \"dftranspose.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Reference/write_outputs/#GenX.write_annual-Tuple{AbstractString, DataFrames.DataFrame}","page":"Outputs Functions","title":"GenX.write_annual","text":"write_annual(fullpath::AbstractString, dfOut::DataFrame)\n\nInternal function for writing annual outputs. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Model_Reference/write_outputs/#GenX.write_fulltimeseries-Tuple{AbstractString, Matrix{Float64}, DataFrames.DataFrame}","page":"Outputs Functions","title":"GenX.write_fulltimeseries","text":"write_fulltimeseries(fullpath::AbstractString, dataOut::Matrix{Float64}, dfOut::DataFrame)\n\nInternal function for writing full time series outputs.

duration storage resources when modeling representative time periods.\n\nStorage inventory balance at beginning of each representative period The constraints in this section are used to approximate the behavior of long-duration energy storage technologies when approximating annual grid operations by modeling operations over representative periods. Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology o in zone z over the representative period m, Delta Q_ozm = 0. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta Q_ozm), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginaligned\n Gamma_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1  =left(1-eta_oz^lossright)times left(Gamma_ozmtimes tau^period -Delta Q_ozmright) -  \n frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 + eta_oz^chargePi_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 quad forall o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendaligned\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start.\n\nStorage inventory change input periods We need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable Q_oz n that models inventory of storage technology o in O in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN. Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018). (Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations The following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period. Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints.

Rather than modeling and optimizing power grid operations at a high temporal resolution (e.g., hourly, over a full year) while evaluating new capacity investments, which can be computationally expensive for large-scale studies with several resources, it may be useful to consider a reduced temporal resolution to model annual grid operations.

Such a time-domain reduction is often employed in capacity expansion models as a way to balance model spatial and temporal resolution as well as representation of dispatch, while ensuring reasonable computational times.

We define capacity reserve margin constraint for subsets of zones, z in mathcalZ^CRM_p, and each subset stands for a locational deliverability area (LDA) or a reserve sharing group. For thermal resources, the available capacity is the total capacity in the LDA derated by the outage rate, epsilon_yzp^CRM. For variable renewable energy (y in mathcalVRE), the available capacity is the maximum discharge potential in time step t derated by the derating factor. For standalone storage and co-located VRE and storage resources (y in mathcalO cup mathcalVS) the available capacity is the net injection into the transmission network plus the net virtual injection corresponding to charge held in reserve, derated by the derating factor. For information on how each component contributes to the capacity reserve margin formulation for co-located VRE and storage resources, see vre_stor_capres!(). For flexible demand resources (y in mathcalDF), the available capacity is the net injection into the transmission network in time step t derated by the derating factor, also stored in the parameter, epsilon_yzp^CRM. If the imported capacity is eligible to provide capacity to the CRM constraint, the inbound powerflow on all lines mathcalL_p^in in time step t will be derated to form the available capacity from outside of the LDA. The reverse is true as well: the outbound derated powerflow on all lines mathcalL_p^out in time step t is taken out from the total available capacity. The derating factor should be equal to the expected availability of the resource during periods when the capacity reserve constraint is binding (e.g. accounting for forced outages during supply constrained periods) and is similar to derating factors used in the capacity markets. On top of the flexible demand resources, demand curtailment can also provide capacity (i.e., demand response or load management). We allow all segments of voluntary demand curtailment, s geq 2 in S, to contribute to capacity requirements. The first segment s = 1 in S corresponds to involuntary demand curtailment or emergency load shedding at the price cap or value of lost demand, and thus does not contribute to reserve requirements. Note that the time step-weighted sum of the shadow prices of this constraint corresponds to the capacity market payments reported by ISOs with mandate capacity market mechanism.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t sum_z  in mathcalZ^CRM_p Big( sum_y in mathcalH epsilon_yzp^CRM times Delta^texttotal_yz + sum_y in mathcalVRE epsilon_yzp^CRM times rho^max_yzt \n\t + sum_y in mathcalO epsilon_yzp^CRM times left(Theta_yzt + Theta^CRM_ozt - Pi^CRM_ozt - Pi_yzt right) + sum_y in mathcalDF epsilon_yzp^CRM times left(Pi_yzt - Theta_yzt right) \n\t + sum_y in mathcalVS^pv (epsilon_yzp^CRM times eta^inverter_yz times rho^maxpv_yzt times Delta^totalpv_yz) \n\t + sum_y in mathcalVS^wind (epsilon_yzp^CRM times rho^maxwind_yzt times Delta^totalwind_yz) \n     + sum_y in mathcalVS^symdc cup mathcalVS^asymdcdis (epsilon_yzp^CRM times eta^inverter_yz times (Theta^dc_yzt + Theta^CRMdc_yzt)) \n     + sum_y in mathcalVS^symac cup mathcalVS^asymacdis (epsilon_yzp^CRM times (Theta^ac_yzt + Theta^CRMac_yzt)) \n     - sum_y in mathcalVS^symdc cup mathcalVS^asymdccha (epsilon_yzp^CRM times fracPi^dc_yzt + Pi^CRMdc_yzteta^inverter_yz) \n     - sum_y in mathcalVS^symdc cup mathcalVS^asymdccha (epsilon_yzp^CRM times (Pi^ac_yzt + Pi^CRMac_yzt)) \n\t + sum_l in mathcalL_p^in epsilon_yzp^CRM times Phi_lt -  sum_l in mathcalL_p^out epsilon_yzp^CRM times Phi_lt\n   \t+  sum_s geq 2 Lambda_stz  Big) \n   \t geq sum_z  in mathcalZ^CRM_p left( left(1 + RM_zp^CRM right) times D_zt right)  hspace1 cm  forall t in mathcalT forall pin mathcalP^CRM\nendaligned\n\nNote that multiple capacity reserve margin requirements can be specified covering different individual zones or aggregations of zones, where the total number of constraints is specified by the GenX settings parameter CapacityReserveMargin (where this parameter should be an integer value > 0).

The constraint p in mathcalP^CO_2 can be flexibly defined for mass-based or rate-based emission limits for one or more model zones, where zones can trade CO_2 emissions permits and earn revenue based on their CO_2 allowance. Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment), the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO_2 price per tonne associated with the emissions target. Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO_2 price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.\n\nThe CO_2 emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways: a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO_2 emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2), b) a demand-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of fulfilled demand and c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of generation.\n\nMass-based emissions constraint\n\nMass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression. For each constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass, we define a set of zones z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass that can trade CO_2 allowance. Input data for each constraint  p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass requires the CO_2 allowance/ budget for each model zone, epsilon^CO_2_zp mass, to be provided in terms of million metric tonnes. For every generator y, the parameter epsilon_yz^CO_2 reflects the specific CO_2 emission intensity in tCO_2/MWh associated with its operation.

Note that if a limit is applied to each zone separately, then the set mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will contain only one zone with no possibility of trading. If a system-wide emission limit constraint is applied, then mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will be equivalent to a set of all zones.\n\nDemand-side rate-based emissions constraint\n\nWe modify the right hand side of the above mass-based constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_demand, to set emissions target based on a CO_2 emission rate limit in tCO_2/MWh times the total demand served (fulfilled) in each zone.

These two expressions are the only expressions which link together individual modules (e.g. resources, transmission assets, policies), which otherwise are self-contained in defining relevant variables, expressions, and constraints.\n\nObjective Function\n\nThe objective function of GenX minimizes total annual electricity system costs over the following six components shown in the equation below:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tsum_y in mathcalG  sum_z in mathcalZ\n\tleft( (pi^INVEST_yz times overlineOmega^size_yz times  Omega_yz)\n\t+ (pi^FOM_yz times overlineOmega^size_yz times  Delta^total_yz)right) + notag \n\tsum_y in mathcalO  sum_z in mathcalZ\n\tleft( (pi^INVESTenergy_yz times    Omega^energy_yz)\n\t+ (pi^FOMenergy_yz times  Delta^totalenergy_yz)right) + notag \n\tsum_y in mathcalO^asym  sum_z in mathcalZ\n\tleft( (pi^INVESTcharge_yz times    Omega^charge_yz)\n\t+ (pi^FOMcharge_yz times  Delta^totalcharge_yz)right) + notag \n\t sum_y in mathcalG  sum_z in mathcalZ sum_t in mathcalT left( omega_ttimes(pi^VOM_yz + pi^FUEL_yz)times Theta_yztright) + sum_y in mathcalO cup DF  sum_z in mathcalZ sum_t in mathcalT left( omega_ttimespi^VOMcharge_yz times Pi_yztright) +notag \n\tsum_s in mathcalS  sum_z in mathcalZ sum_t in mathcalTleft(omega_t times n_s^slope times Lambda_sztright) + sum_t in mathcalT  left(omega_t times pi^unmet_rsv times r^unmet_tright) notag \n\tsum_y in mathcalH  sum_z in mathcalZ sum_t in mathcalTleft(omega_t times pi^START_yz times chi_sztright) + notag \n\t sum_l in mathcalLleft(pi^TCAP_l times bigtriangleupvarphi^max_lright)\nendaligned\n\nThe first summation represents the fixed costs of generation/discharge over all zones and technologies, which refects the sum of the annualized capital cost, pi^INVEST_yz, times the total new capacity added (if any),  plus the Fixed O&M cost, pi^FOM_yz, times the net installed generation capacity, overlineOmega^size_yz times Delta^total_yz (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).\n\nThe second summation corresponds to the fixed cost of installed energy storage capacity and is summed over only the storage resources. This term includes the sum of the annualized energy capital cost, pi^INVESTenergy_yz, times the total new energy capacity added (if any), plus the Fixed O&M cost, pi^FOM energy_yz, times the net installed energy storage capacity, Delta^total_yz (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).\n\nThe third summation corresponds to the fixed cost of installed charging power capacity and is summed over only over storage resources with independent/asymmetric charge and discharge power components (mathcalO^asym). This term includes the sum of the annualized charging power capital cost, pi^INVESTcharge_yz, times the total new charging power capacity added (if any), plus the Fixed O&M cost, pi^FOM energy_yz, times the net installed charging power capacity, Delta^total_yz (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).\n\nThe fourth and fifth summations corresponds to the operational cost across all zones, technologies, and time steps. The fourth summation represents the sum of fuel cost, pi^FUEL_yz (if any), plus variable O&M cost, pi^VOM_yz times the energy generation/discharge by generation or storage resources (or demand satisfied via flexible demand resources, yinmathcalDF) in time step t, Theta_yzt, and the weight of each time step t, omega_t, where omega_t is equal to 1 when modeling grid operations over the entire year (8760 hours), but otherwise is equal to the number of hours in the year represented by the representative time step, t such that the sum of omega_t forall t in T = 8760, approximating annual operating costs. The fifth summation represents the variable charging O&M cost, pi^VOMcharge_yz times the energy withdrawn for charging by storage resources (or demand deferred by flexible demand resources) in time step t , Pi_yzt and the annual weight of time step t,omega_t.\n\nThe sixth summation represents the total cost of unserved demand across all segments s of a segment-wise price-elastic demand curve, equal to the marginal value of consumption (or cost of non-served energy), n_s^slope, times the amount of non-served energy, Lambda_yzt, for each segment on each zone during each time step (weighted by omega_t).\n\nThe seventh summation represents the total cost of not meeting hourly operating reserve requirements, where pi^unmet_rsv is the cost penalty per unit of non-served reserve requirement, and r^unmet_t is the amount of non-served reserve requirement in each time step (weighted by omega_t).\n\nThe eighth summation corresponds to the startup costs incurred by technologies to which unit commitment decisions apply (e.g. y in mathcalUC), equal to the cost of start-up, pi^START_yz, times the number of startup events, chi_yzt, for the cluster of units in each zone and time step (weighted by omega_t).\n\nThe last term corresponds to the transmission reinforcement or construction costs, for each transmission line in the model. Transmission reinforcement costs are equal to the sum across all lines of the product between the transmission reinforcement/construction cost, pi^TCAP_l, times the additional transmission capacity variable, bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l. Note that fixed O\\&M and replacement capital costs (depreciation) for existing transmission capacity is treated as a sunk cost and not included explicitly in the GenX objective function.\n\nIn summary, the objective function can be understood as the minimization of costs associated with five sets of different decisions: (1) where and how to invest on capacity, (2) how to dispatch or operate that capacity, (3) which consumer demand segments to serve or curtail, (4) how to cycle and commit thermal units subject to unit commitment decisions, (5) and where and how to invest in additional transmission network capacity to increase power transfer capacity between zones. Note however that each of these components are considered jointly and the optimization is performed over the whole problem at once as a monolithic co-optimization problem.\n\nPower Balance\n\nThe power balance constraint of the model ensures that electricity demand is met at every time step in each zone. As shown in the constraint, electricity demand, D_tz, at each time step and for each zone must be strictly equal to the sum of generation, Theta_yzt, from thermal technologies (mathcalH), curtailable VRE (mathcalVRE), must-run resources (mathcalMR), and hydro resources (mathcalW). At the same time, energy storage devices (mathcalO) can discharge energy, Theta_yzt to help satisfy demand, while when these devices are charging, Pi_yzt, they increase demand. For the case of flexible demand resources (mathcalDF), delaying demand (equivalent to charging virtual storage), Pi_yzt, decreases demand while satisfying delayed demand (equivalent to discharging virtual demand), Theta_yzt, increases demand. Price-responsive demand curtailment, Lambda_szt, also reduces demand. Finally, power flows, Phi_lt, on each line l into or out of a zone (defined by the network map varphi^map_lz), are considered in the demand balance equation for each zone. By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign in the below constraint. At the same time losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone. The losses function beta_lt(cdot) will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see Transmission section).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t sum_yin mathcalHTheta_yzt +sum_yin mathcalVRETheta_yzt +sum_yin mathcalMRTheta_yzt + sum_yin mathcalO(Theta_yzt-Pi_yzt) + notag\n\t sum_yin mathcalDF(-Theta_yzt+Pi_yzt) +sum_yin mathcalWTheta_yzt+ notag\n\t+ sum_sin mathcalSLambda_szt  - sum_lin mathcalL(varphi^map_lz times Phi_lt) -frac12 sum_lin mathcalL(varphi^map_lz times beta_lt(cdot)) = D_zt\n\tforall zin mathcalZ  t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nArguments\n\nsetup::Dict: Dictionary containing the settings for the model.\ninputs::Dict: Dictionary containing the inputs for the model.\nOPTIMIZER::MOI.OptimizerWithAttributes: The optimizer to use for solving the model.\n\nReturns\n\nModel: The model object containing the entire optimization problem model to be solved by solve_model.jl\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"Public_API/public_api/#GenX.solve_model","page":"Public API","title":"GenX.solve_model","text":"solve_model(EP::Model, setup::Dict)\n\nDescription: Solves and extracts solution variables for later processing\n\nArguments\n\nEP::Model: a JuMP model representing the energy optimization problem\nsetup::Dict: a Dict containing GenX setup flags\n\nReturns\n\nEP::Model: the solved JuMP model\nsolver_time::Float64: time taken to solve the model\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"Public_API/public_api/#GenX.write_outputs","page":"Public API","title":"GenX.write_outputs","text":"write_outputs(EP::Model, path::AbstractString, setup::Dict, inputs::Dict)\n\nFunction for the entry-point for writing the different output files.

This algorithm was developed by Brill Jr, E. D., 1979 and introduced to energy system planning by DeCarolia, J. F., 2011.\n\nTo create the MGA formulation, we replace the cost-minimizing objective function of GenX with a new objective function that creates multiple generation portfolios by zone. We further add a new budget constraint based on the optimal objective function value f^* of the least-cost model and the user-specified value of slack delta. After adding the slack constraint, the resulting MGA formulation is given as (MGAAnnualGeneration = 0 in the genx_settings.yml file, or not set):\n\nbeginaligned\n\ttextmaxmin quad\n\tsum_z in mathcalZsum_r in mathcalR beta_zr^kP_zr\n\ttextst quad\n\tP_zr = sum_y in mathcalGC_yzr  \n\t f leq f^* + delta \n\tAx = b\nendaligned\n\nwhere, beta_zr is a random objective function coefficient betwen 01 for MGA iteration k.

Theta_ytzr is a generation of technology y in zone z in time period t that belongs to a resource type r. We aggregate Theta_ytzr into a new variable P_zr that represents total generation from technology type r in a zone z. \n\nIn the second constraint in both the above formulations, delta denote the increase in budget from the least-cost solution and f represents the expression for the total system cost. The constraint Ax = b represents all other constraints in the power system model.

Hydroelectric generators with water storage reservoirs (y in mathcalW) are effectively modeled as energy storage devices that cannot charge from the grid and instead receive exogenous inflows to their storage reservoirs, reflecting stream flow inputs. For resources with unknown reservoir capacity (y in mathcalW^nocap), their operation is parametrized by their generation efficiency, eta_yz^down, and energy inflows to the reservoir at every time-step, represented as a fraction of the total power capacity,(rho^max_yzt).  In case reservoir capacity is known (y in mathcalW^cap), an additional parameter, mu^stor_yz, referring to the ratio of energy capacity to discharge power capacity, is used to define the available reservoir storage capacity.\n\nStorage inventory balance Reservoir hydro systems are governed by the storage inventory balance constraint given below. This constraint enforces that energy level of the reservoir resource y and zone z in time step t (Gamma_yzt) is defined as the sum of the reservoir level in the previous time step, less the amount of electricity generated, Theta_yzt (accounting for the generation efficiency, eta_yz^down), minus any spillage varrho_yzt, plus the hourly inflows into the reservoir (equal to the installed reservoir discharged capacity times the normalized hourly inflow parameter rho^max_yz t).\n\nbeginaligned\nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 -frac1eta_yz^downTheta_yzt - varrho_yzt + rho^max_yzt times Delta^total_yz  hspace1 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt+tau^period-1 -frac1eta_yz^downTheta_yzt - varrho_yzt + rho^max_yzt times Delta^total_yz  hspace1 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nWe implement time-wrapping to endogenize the definition of the intial state prior to the first period with the following assumption. If time step t is the first time step of the year then storage inventory at t is defined based on last time step of the year. Alternatively, if time step t is the first time step of a representative period, then storage inventory at t is defined based on the last time step of the representative period. Thus, when using representative periods, the storage balance constraint for hydro resources does not allow for energy exchange between representative periods. Note: in future updates, an option to model hydro resources with large reservoirs that can transfer energy across sample periods will be implemented, similar to the functions for modeling long duration energy storage in long_duration_storage.jl.\n\nRamping Limits The following constraints enforce hourly changes in power output (ramps down and ramps up) to be less than the maximum ramp rates (kappa^down_yz and kappa^up_yz ) in per unit terms times the total installed capacity of technology y (Delta^total_yz).\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt + f_yzt + r_yzt - Theta_yzt-1 - f_yzt-1 leq kappa^up_yz times Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt-1 + f_yzt-1  + r_yzt-1 - Theta_yzt - f_yztleq kappa^down_yz Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nRamping constraints are enforced for all time steps except the first time step of the year or first time of each representative period when using representative periods to model grid operations.\n\nPower generation and stream flow bounds Electricity production plus total spilled power from hydro resources is constrained to always be above a minimum output parameter, rho^min_yz, to represent operational constraints related to minimum stream flows or other demands for water from hydro reservoirs. Electricity production is constrained by either the the net installed capacity or by the energy level in the reservoir in the prior time step, whichever is more binding. For the latter constraint, the constraint for the first time step of the year (or the first time step of each representative period) is implemented based on energy storage level in last time step of the year (or last time step of each representative period).\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt + varrho_yzt  geq rho^min_yz times Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yt  leq times Delta^total_yz\nhspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ tin mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt leq  Gamma_yt-1\nhspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ tin mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nReservoir energy capacity constraint In case the reservoir capacity is known (y in W^cap), then an additional constraint enforces the total stored energy in each time step to be less than or equal to the available reservoir capacity.

As implemented, flexible demand resources (y in mathcalDF) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step t, rho^max_yzt, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, tau^advance_yz and tau^delay_yz, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, eta_yz^dflex.\n\nTracking total deferred demand The operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows. The first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step.  Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served (Gamma_yzt) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step t (Theta_yzt) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step (Pi_yzt). Note that variable Gamma_yzt in mathbbR, forall y in mathcalDF t  in mathcalT. Similar to hydro inventory or storage state of charge constraints, for the first time step of the year (or each representative period), we define the deferred demand level based on level of deferred demand in the last time step of the year (or each representative period).\n\nbeginaligned\nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt +tau^period-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nBounds on available demand flexibility At any given time step, the amount of demand that can be shifted or deferred cannot exceed the maximum deferrable demand, defined by product of the availability factor (rho^max_yt) times the available capacity(Delta^total_yz).\n\nbeginaligned\nPi_yt leq rho^max_yztDelta_yz hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nAt any given time step, the amount of demand that can be met cannot exceed the capacity of the FLEX resources.\n\nbeginaligned\neta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt leq Delta_yz hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nMaximum time delay and advancements Delayed demand must then be served within a fixed number of time steps. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand satisfied (Theta_yzt) in the following tau^delay_yz time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + tau^delay_yz) to be greater than or equal to the level of energy deferred during time step t.\n\nbeginaligned\nsum_e=t+1^t+tau^delay_yzTheta_yze geq Gamma_yzt\n    hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDFz in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nA similar constraints maximum time steps of demand advancement.

The operational constraints for VRE resources are a function of each technology's time-dependent hourly capacity factor (or availability factor, rho^max_yzt), in per unit terms, and the total available capacity (Delta^total_yz).\n\nPower output in each time step For each VRE technology type y and model zone z, the model allows for incorporating multiple bins with different parameters for resource quality (rho^max_yzt), maximum availability (overlineOmega_yz) and investment cost (Pi^INVEST_yz, for example, due to interconnection cost differences). We define variables related to installed capacity (Delta_yz) and retired capacity (Delta_yz) for all resource bins for a particular VRE resource type y and zone z (overlinemathcalVRE^yz). However, the variable corresponding to power output in each timestep is only defined for the first bin. Parameter VREIndex_yz, is used to keep track of the first bin, where VREIndex_yz=1 for the first bin and VREIndex_yz=0 for the remaining bins. This approach allows for modeling many different bins per VRE technology type and zone while significantly reducing the number of operational variable (related to power output for each time step from each bin) added to the model with every additional bin. Thus, the maximum power output for each VRE resource type in each zone is given by the following equation:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt leq sum_(xz)in overlinemathcalVRE^xzrho^max_xzt times Delta^total_xz  hspace2 cm  forall yz in (yz)VREIndex_yz=1 z in mathcalZt in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe above constraint is defined as an inequality instead of an equality to allow for VRE power output to be curtailed if desired. This adds the possibility of introducing VRE curtailment as an extra degree of freedom to guarantee that generation exactly meets demand in each time step. Note that if OperationalReserves=1 indicating that frequency regulation and operating reserves are modeled, then this function calls curtailable_variable_renewable_operational_reserves!(), which replaces the above constraints with a formulation inclusive of reserve provision.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Model_Reference/Resources/curtailable_variable_renewable/#GenX.curtailable_variable_renewable_operational_reserves!-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict}","page":"Curtailable Variable Renewable","title":"GenX.curtailable_variable_renewable_operational_reserves!","text":"curtailable_variable_renewable_operational_reserves!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict)\n\nWhen modeling operating reserves, this function is called by curtailable_variable_renewable(), which modifies the constraint for maximum power output in each time step from VRE resources to account for procuring some of the available capacity for frequency regulation (f_yzt) and upward operating (spinning) reserves (r_yzt).\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt + f_yzt + r_yzt leq sum_(xz)in overlinemathcalVRE^xzrho^max_xzttimes Delta^total_xz  hspace01 cm   forall yz in (yz)VREIndex_yz=1 z in mathcalZt in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe amount of downward frequency regulation reserves also cannot exceed the current power output.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tf_yzt leq Theta_yzt\n\tforall yz in (yz)VREIndex_yz=1 z in mathcalZt in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe amount of frequency regulation and operating reserves procured in each time step is bounded by the user-specified fraction (upsilon^reg_yz,upsilon^rsv_yz) of available capacity in each period for each reserve type, reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the VRE resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins).

Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology o in zone z over the representative period m, Delta Q_ozm = 0. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta Q_ozm), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginaligned\n Gamma_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1  =left(1-eta_oz^lossright)times left(Gamma_ozmtimes tau^period -Delta Q_ozmright) -  \n frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 + eta_oz^chargePi_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 quad forall o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendaligned\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start. \nStorage inventory change input periods We need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable Q_oz n that models inventory of storage technology o in O in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN. Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018).\n\n(Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations\n\nThe following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).

This term includes the sum of the annualized energy capital cost, pi^INVESTenergy_yz, times the total new energy capacity added (if any), plus the Fixed O&M cost, pi^FOM energy_yz, times the net installed energy storage capacity, Delta^total_yz (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).\n\nThe third summation corresponds to the fixed cost of installed charging power capacity and is summed over only over storage resources with independent/asymmetric charge and discharge power components (mathcalO^asym). This term includes the sum of the annualized charging power capital cost, pi^INVESTcharge_yz, times the total new charging power capacity added (if any), plus the Fixed O&M cost, pi^FOM energy_yz, times the net installed charging power capacity, Delta^total_yz (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).\n\nThe fourth and fifth summations corresponds to the operational cost across all zones, technologies, and time steps. The fourth summation represents the sum of fuel cost, pi^FUEL_yz (if any), plus variable O&M cost, pi^VOM_yz times the energy generation/discharge by generation or storage resources (or demand satisfied via flexible demand resources, yinmathcalDF) in time step t, Theta_yzt, and the weight of each time step t, omega_t, where omega_t is equal to 1 when modeling grid operations over the entire year (8760 hours), but otherwise is equal to the number of hours in the year represented by the representative time step, t such that the sum of omega_t forall t in T = 8760, approximating annual operating costs. The fifth summation represents the variable charging O&M cost, pi^VOMcharge_yz times the energy withdrawn for charging by storage resources (or demand deferred by flexible demand resources) in time step t , Pi_yzt and the annual weight of time step t,omega_t.\n\nThe sixth summation represents the total cost of unserved demand across all segments s of a segment-wise price-elastic demand curve, equal to the marginal value of consumption (or cost of non-served energy), n_s^slope, times the amount of non-served energy, Lambda_yzt, for each segment on each zone during each time step (weighted by omega_t).\n\nThe seventh summation represents the total cost of not meeting hourly operating reserve requirements, where pi^unmet_rsv is the cost penalty per unit of non-served reserve requirement, and r^unmet_t is the amount of non-served reserve requirement in each time step (weighted by omega_t).\n\nThe eighth summation corresponds to the startup costs incurred by technologies to which unit commitment decisions apply (e.g. y in mathcalUC), equal to the cost of start-up, pi^START_yz, times the number of startup events, chi_yzt, for the cluster of units in each zone and time step (weighted by omega_t).\n\nThe last term corresponds to the transmission reinforcement or construction costs, for each transmission line in the model. Transmission reinforcement costs are equal to the sum across all lines of the product between the transmission reinforcement/construction cost, pi^TCAP_l, times the additional transmission capacity variable, bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l. Note that fixed O\\&M and replacement capital costs (depreciation) for existing transmission capacity is treated as a sunk cost and not included explicitly in the GenX objective function.\n\nIn summary, the objective function can be understood as the minimization of costs associated with five sets of different decisions: (1) where and how to invest on capacity, (2) how to dispatch or operate that capacity, (3) which consumer demand segments to serve or curtail, (4) how to cycle and commit thermal units subject to unit commitment decisions, (5) and where and how to invest in additional transmission network capacity to increase power transfer capacity between zones. Note however that each of these components are considered jointly and the optimization is performed over the whole problem at once as a monolithic co-optimization problem.\n\nPower Balance\n\nThe power balance constraint of the model ensures that electricity demand is met at every time step in each zone. As shown in the constraint, electricity demand, D_tz, at each time step and for each zone must be strictly equal to the sum of generation, Theta_yzt, from thermal technologies (mathcalH), curtailable VRE (mathcalVRE), must-run resources (mathcalMR), and hydro resources (mathcalW). At the same time, energy storage devices (mathcalO) can discharge energy, Theta_yzt to help satisfy demand, while when these devices are charging, Pi_yzt, they increase demand. For the case of flexible demand resources (mathcalDF), delaying demand (equivalent to charging virtual storage), Pi_yzt, decreases demand while satisfying delayed demand (equivalent to discharging virtual demand), Theta_yzt, increases demand. Price-responsive demand curtailment, Lambda_szt, also reduces demand. Finally, power flows, Phi_lt, on each line l into or out of a zone (defined by the network map varphi^map_lz), are considered in the demand balance equation for each zone. By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign in the below constraint. At the same time losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone. The losses function beta_lt(cdot) will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see Transmission section).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t sum_yin mathcalHTheta_yzt +sum_yin mathcalVRETheta_yzt +sum_yin mathcalMRTheta_yzt + sum_yin mathcalO(Theta_yzt-Pi_yzt) + notag\n\t sum_yin mathcalDF(-Theta_yzt+Pi_yzt) +sum_yin mathcalWTheta_yzt+ notag\n\t+ sum_sin mathcalSLambda_szt  - sum_lin mathcalL(varphi^map_lz times Phi_lt) -frac12 sum_lin mathcalL(varphi^map_lz times beta_lt(cdot)) = D_zt\n\tforall zin mathcalZ  t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nArguments\n\nsetup::Dict: Dictionary containing the settings for the model.\ninputs::Dict: Dictionary containing the inputs for the model.\nOPTIMIZER::MOI.OptimizerWithAttributes: The optimizer to use for solving the model.\n\nReturns\n\nModel: The model object containing the entire optimization problem model to be solved by solve_model.jl\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Model_Concept_Overview/model_introduction/#GenX-Model-Introduction","page":"Model Introduction","title":"GenX Model Introduction","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Model_Concept_Overview/model_introduction/#Introduction","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Model_Concept_Overview/model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"GenX allows for the simultaneous co-optimization of several interlinked power system decision layers, described below:","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Concept_Overview/model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"Capacity expansion planning (e.g., investment and retirement decisions for a full range of centralized and distributed generation, storage, and demand-side resources)\nHourly dispatch of generation, storage, and demand-side resources,\nUnit commitment decisions and operational constraints for thermal generators,\nCommitment of generation, storage, and demand-side capacity to meet system operating reserves requirements,\nCommitment of generation, storage, and demand-side capacity to meet capacity reserve requirements,\nTransmission network power flows (including losses) and network expansion decisions, and\nSeveral optional policy constraints","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Concept_Overview/model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"Depending on the dimensionality of the problem, it may not be possible to model all decision layers at the highest possible resolution of detail, so the GenX model is designed to be highly configurable, allowing the user to specify the level of detail or abstraction along each of these layers or to omit one or more layers from consideration entirely.","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Concept_Overview/model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"For example, while investment and dispatch decisions (Layers 1 and 2) are a consistent feature of the model under all configurations, the user has several options with regards to representing the operational constraints on various thermal power plants (e.g., coal, gas, nuclear, and biomass generators).

Furthermore, different levels of resolution can be selected for each individual resource type, as desired (e.g., larger thermal units can be represented with integer unit commitment decisions while smaller units can be treated as fully continuous).

(A DC optimal power flow formulation is in development.) In cases where a nodal or zonal transmission model is employed, network capacity expansion decisions can be modeled or ignored, and transmission losses can be represented either as a linear function of power flows or a piecewise linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows between nodes or zones (as per Zhang et al., 2013, Fitiwi et al., 2016), with the number of segments in the piecewise approximation specified by the user as desired.

In a typical binary unit commitment formulation, each unit is either on or off. With the clustered unit commitment formulation, one or more cluster(s) of similar generators are clustered by type and zone (typically using heat rate and fixed O\\&M cost to create clusters), and the integer commitment state variable for each cluster varies from zero to the number of units in the cluster, fracDelta^total_yzOmega^size_yz. As discussed in \\cite{Palmintier2014}, this approach replaces the large set of binary commitment decisions and associated constraints, which scale directly with the number of individual units, with a smaller set of integer commitment states and  constraints, one for each cluster y. The dimensionality of the problem thus scales with the number of units of a given type in each zone, rather than by the number of discrete units, significantly improving computational efficiency. However, this method entails the simplifying assumption that all clustered units have identical parameters (e.g., capacity size, ramp rates, heat rate) and that all committed units in a given time step t are operating at the same power output per unit.\n\nPower balance expression\n\nThis function adds the sum of power generation from thermal units subject to unit commitment (Theta_y in UCt in Tz in Z) to the power balance expression.\n\nStartup and shutdown events (thermal plant cycling)\n\nCapacitated limits on unit commitment decision variables\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment (y in mathcalUC) adhere to the following constraints on commitment states, startup events, and shutdown events, which limit each decision to be no greater than the maximum number of discrete units installed (as per the following three constraints):\n\nbeginaligned\nnu_yzt leq fracDelta^texttotal_yzOmega^size_yz\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nchi_yzt leq fracDelta^texttotal_yzOmega^size_yz\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nzeta_yzt leq fracDelta^texttotal_yzOmega^size_yz\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 1-3 in the code)\n\nwhere decision nu_yzt designates the commitment state of generator cluster y in zone z at time t, decision chi_yzt represents number of startup decisions, decision zeta_yzt represents number of shutdown decisions, Delta^texttotal_yz is the total installed capacity, and parameter Omega^size_yz is the unit size.\n\nCommitment state constraint linking start-up and shut-down decisions\n\nAdditionally, the following constarint maintains the commitment state variable across time, nu_yzt, as the sum of the commitment state in the prior, nu_yzt-1, period plus the number of units started in the current period, chi_yzt, less the number of units shut down in the current period, zeta_yzt:\n\nbeginaligned\nnu_yzt =nu_yzt-1 + chi_yzt - zeta_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT^interior \nnu_yzt =nu_yzt +tau^period-1 + chi_yzt - zeta_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraint 4 in the code)\n\nLike other time-coupling constraints, this constraint wraps around to link the commitment state in the first time step of the year (or each representative period), t in mathcalT^start, to the last time step of the year (or each representative period), t+tau^period-1.\n\nRamping constraints\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment (y in UC) adhere to the following ramping constraints on hourly changes in power output:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt-1 + f_y z t-1+r_y z t-1 - Theta_yzt-f_y z tleq  kappa^down_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot (nu_yzt - chi_yzt)  6pt\n\tqquad  -  rho^min_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot chi_yzt  hspace05cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT  6pt\n\tqquad  +  textmin( rho^max_yzt textmax( rho^min_yz kappa^down_yz ) ) cdot Omega^size_yz cdot zeta_yzt \nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt+f_y z t+r_y z t - Theta_yzt-1- f_y z t-1 leq  kappa^up_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot (nu_yzt - chi_yzt)  6pt\n\tqquad  +  textmin( rho^max_yzt textmax( rho^min_yz kappa^up_yz ) ) cdot Omega^size_yz cdot chi_yzt  hspace05cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT 6pt\n\tqquad  -  rho^min_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot zeta_yzt \nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 5-6 in the code)\n\nwhere decision Theta_yzt, f_y z t, and r_y z t are respectively, the energy injected into the grid, regulation, and reserve by technology y in zone z at time t, parameter kappa_yzt^updown is the maximum ramp-up or ramp-down rate as a percentage of installed capacity, parameter rho_yz^min is the minimum stable power output per unit of installed capacity, and parameter rho_yzt^max is the maximum available generation per unit of installed capacity. These constraints account for the ramping limits for committed (online) units as well as faster changes in power enabled by units starting or shutting down in the current time step.\n\nMinimum and maximum power output\n\nIf not modeling regulation and spinning reserves, thermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints that ensure power output does not exceed minimum and maximum feasible levels:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt geq rho^min_yz times Omega^size_yz times nu_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt leq rho^max_yz times Omega^size_yz times nu_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 7-8 the code)\n\nIf modeling reserves and regulation, these constraints are replaced by those established in this thermal_commit_operational_reserves().\n\nMinimum and maximum up and down time\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints on the minimum time steps after start-up before a unit can shutdown again (minimum up time) and the minimum time steps after shut-down before a unit can start-up again (minimum down time):\n\nbeginaligned\n\tnu_yzt geq displaystyle sum_hatt = t-(tau^up_yz-1)^t chi_yzhatt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tfracoverlineDelta_yz + Omega_yz - Delta_yzOmega^size_yz -  nu_yzt geq displaystyle sum_hatt = t-(tau^down_yz-1)^t zeta_yzhatt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 9-10 in the code)\n\nwhere tau_yz^updown is the minimum up or down time for units in generating cluster y in zone z.\n\nLike with the ramping constraints, the minimum up and down constraint time also wrap around from the start of each time period to the end of each period.

The first of these two constraints enforces storage inventory balance for interior time      steps (t in mathcalT^interior), while the second enforces storage balance constraint for the initial time step (t in mathcalT^start):\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 - fracTheta^dc_yzteta_yz^dischargedc - fracTheta^ac_yzteta_yz^dischargeac + eta_yz^chargedc times Pi^dc_yzt + eta_yz^chargeac times Pi^ac_yzt \n     - eta_yz^loss times Gamma_yzt-1  quad forall y in mathcalVS^stor z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior\n\t  Gamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt+tau^period-1 - fracTheta^dc_yzteta_yz^dischargedc - fracTheta^ac_yzteta_yz^dischargeac + eta_yz^chargedc times Pi^dc_yzt + eta_yz^chargeac times Pi^ac_yzt \n     - eta_yz^loss times Gamma_yzt+tau^period-1  quad forall y in mathcalVS^stor z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nThe last constraint limits the volume of energy stored at any time, Gamma_yzt, to be less than the installed energy storage capacity, Delta^total energy_yz. \n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_yzt leq Delta^total energy_yz  quad forall y in mathcalVS^stor z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe next set of constraints only apply to symmetric storage resources (all y in mathcalVS^symdc cup y in mathcalVS^symac).      For storage technologies with symmetric charge and discharge capacity (all y in mathcalVS^symdc  cup y in mathcalVS^symac),      since storage resources generally represent a 'cluster' of multiple similar storage devices of the same type/cost in the same zone, GenX      permits storage resources to simultaneously charge and discharge (as some units could be charging while others discharge). The      simultaneous sum of DC and AC charge, Pi^dc_yzt Pi^ac_yzt, and discharge, Theta^dc_yzt Theta^ac_yzt, is limited      by the total installed energy capacity, Delta^total energy_oz, multiplied by the power to energy ratio, mu_yz^dcstor      mu_yz^acstor. Without any capacity reserve margin constraints or operating reserves, the symmetric AC and DC storage resources are constrained as:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Theta^dc_yzt + Pi^dc_yzt leq mu^dcstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symdc z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n      Theta^ac_yzt + Pi^ac_yzt leq mu^acstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symac z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nSymmetric storage resources with only capacity reserve margin constraints follow a similar constraint that incorporates the 'virtual' discharging      and charging that occurs and limits the simultaneously charging, discharging, virtual charging, and virtual discharging of the battery resource: \n\nbeginaligned\n      Theta^dc_yzt + Theta^CRMdc_yzt + Pi^dc_yzt + Pi^CRMdc_yzt \n      leq mu^dcstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symdc z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n      Theta^ac_yzt + Theta^CRMac_yzt + Pi^ac_yzt + Pi^CRMac_yzt \n       leq mu^acstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symac z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nSymmetric storage resources only subject to operating reserves have additional variables to represent contributions of frequency regulation and upwards operating reserves while the storage is charging DC or AC      (f^dccha_yzt f^accha_yzt) and discharging DC or AC (f^dcdis_yzt f^acdis_yzt r^dcdis_yzt r^acdis_yzt). Note that as storage resources can contribute to regulation and      reserves while either charging or discharging, the proxy variables f^dccha_yzt f^accha_yzt f^dcdis_yzt f^acdis_yzt r^dcdis_yzt r^acdis_yzt are created for storage      components.\n\nbeginaligned\n      Theta^dc_yzt + f^dcdis_yzt + r^dcdis_yzt + Pi^dc_yzt + f^dccha_yzt \n        leq mu^dcstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symdc z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n      Theta^ac_yzt + f^acdis_yzt + r^acdis_yzt + Pi^ac_yzt + f^accha_yzt \n        leq mu^acstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symac z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nFor symmetric storage resources with both capacity reserve margin and operating reserves, DC and AC resources are subject to the following constraints:\n\nbeginaligned\n      Theta^dc_yzt + Theta^CRMdc_yzt + f^dcdis_yzt + r^dcdis_yzt + Pi^dc_yzt + Pi^CRMdc_yzt + f^dccha_yzt \n        leq mu^dcstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symdc z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n      Theta^ac_yzt + Theta^CRMac_yzt + f^acdis_yzt + r^acdis_yzt + Pi^ac_yzt + Pi^CRMac_yzt + f^accha_yzt \n        leq mu^acstor_yz times Delta^totalenergy_yz quad forall y in mathcalVS^symac z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nLong duration energy storage constraints are activated by the function lds_vre_stor!().

Utility-scale solar PV and/or wind VRE technologies  can be modeled at the same site with or without storage technologies. Storage resources  can be charged/discharged behind the meter through the inverter (DC) and through AC charging/discharging  capabilities. Each resource can be configured to have any combination of the following components:  solar PV, wind, DC discharging/charging storage, and AC discharging/charging storage resources. For  storage resources, both long duration energy storage and short-duration energy storage can be modeled,  via asymmetric or symmetric charging and discharging options. Each resource connects  to the grid via a grid connection component, which is the only required decision variable  that each resource must have. If the configured resource has either solar PV and/or DC discharging/charging  storage capabilities, an inverter decision variable is also created. The full module with the decision  variables and interactions can be found below. \n\n(Image: Configurable Co-located VRE and Storage Module Interactions and Decision Variables) Figure. Configurable Co-located VRE and Storage Module Interactions and Decision Variables\n\nThis module is split such that functions are called for each configurable component of a co-located resource:      inverter_vre_stor(), solar_vre_stor!(), wind_vre_stor!(), stor_vre_stor!(), lds_vre_stor!(),      and investment_charge_vre_stor!(). The function vre_stor!() specifically ensures      that all necessary functions are called to activate the appropriate constraints, creates constraints that apply to      multiple components (i.e. inverter and grid connection balances and maximums), and activates all of the policies      that have been created (minimum capacity requirements, maximum capacity requirements, capacity reserve margins, operating reserves, and     energy share requirements can all be turned on for this module). Note that not all of these variables are indexed by each co-located VRE and storage resource (for example, some co-located resources      may only have a solar PV component and battery technology or just a wind component). Thus, the function vre_stor!()      ensures indexing issues do not arise across the various potential configurations of co-located VRE and storage      module but showcases all constraints as if each decision variable (that may be only applicable to certain components)      is indexed by each y in mathcalVS for readability. \n\nThe first constraint is created with the function vre_stor!() and exists for all resources,      regardless of the VRE and storage components that each resource contains and regardless of the policies      invoked for the module. This constraint represents the energy balance, ensuring net DC power (discharge      of battery, PV generation, and charge of battery) and net AC power (discharge of battery, wind generation,      and charge of battery) are equal to the technology's total discharging to and charging from the grid:\n\nbeginaligned\n     Theta_yzt - Pi_yzt = Theta_yzt^wind + Theta_yzt^ac - Pi_yzt^ac + eta^inverter_yz times (Theta_yzt^pv + Theta_yzt^dc) - fracPi^dc_yzteta^inverter_yz \n     forall y in mathcalVS forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe second constraint is also created with the function vre_stor!() and exists for all resources,      regardless of the VRE and storage components that each resource contains.

The capacity reserve margin      formulation for GenX is further elaborated upon in cap_reserve_margin!(). For co-located resources (y in mathcalVS),      the available capacity to contribute to the capacity reserve margin is the net injection into the transmission network (which      can come from the solar PV, wind, and/or storage component) plus the net virtual injection corresponding to charge held in reserve      (which can only come from the storage component), derated by the derating factor. If a capacity reserve margin is modeled, variables      for virtual charge DC, Pi^CRM dc_yzt, virtual charge AC, Pi^CRM ac_yzt, virtual discharge DC, Theta^CRM dc_yzt,      virtual discharge AC, Theta^CRM ac_ozt, and virtual state of charge, Gamma^CRM_yzt, are created to represent contributions that a storage device makes to      the capacity reserve margin without actually generating power. These represent power that the storage device could have discharged      or consumed if called upon to do so, based on its available state of charge. Importantly, a dedicated set of variables      and constraints are created to ensure that any virtual contributions to the capacity reserve margin could be made as      actual charge/discharge if necessary without affecting system operations in any other timesteps (similar to the standalone      storage capacity reserve margin constraints). \n\nIf a capacity reserve margin is modeled, then the following constraints track the relationship between the virtual charge variables,      Pi^CRMdc_yzt Pi^CRMac_yzt, virtual discharge variables, Theta^CRM dc_yzt Theta^CRM ac_yzt,      and the virtual state of charge, Gamma^CRM_yzt, representing the amount of state of charge that must be held in reserve      to enable these virtual capacity reserve margin contributions and ensuring that the storage device could deliver its pledged      capacity if called upon to do so without affecting its operations in other timesteps. Gamma^CRM_yzt is tracked similarly      to the devices' overall state of charge based on its value in the previous timestep and the virtual charge and discharge in the      current timestep. Unlike the regular state of charge, virtual discharge Theta^CRMdc_yzt Theta^CRMac_yzt increases      Gamma^CRM_yzt (as more charge must be held in reserve to support more virtual discharge), and the virtual charge      Pi^CRMdc_yzt Pi^CRMac_yzt reduces Gamma^CRM_yzt. Similar to the state of charge constraints in the      stor_vre_stor!() function, the first of these two constraints enforces storage inventory balance for interior time      steps (t in mathcalT^interior), while the second enforces storage balance constraint for the initial time step (t in mathcalT^start):\n\nbeginaligned\n\t Gamma^CRM_yzt = Gamma^CRM_yzt-1 + fracTheta^CRM dc_yzteta_yz^dischargedc + fracTheta^CRMac_yzteta_yz^dischargeac - eta_yz^chargedc times Pi^CRMdc_yzt - eta_yz^chargeac times Pi^CRM ac_yzt \n     - eta_yz^loss times Gamma^CRM_yzt-1  quad forall y in mathcalVS^stor z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior\n      Gamma^CRM_yzt = Gamma^CRM_yzt+tau^period-1 + fracTheta^CRMdc_yzteta_yz^dischargedc + fracTheta^CRMac_yzteta_yz^dischargeac - eta_yz^chargedc times Pi^CRMdc_yzt - eta_yz^chargeac times Pi^CRMac_yzt \n     - eta_yz^loss times Gamma^CRM_yzt+tau^period-1  quad forall y in mathcalVS^stor z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nThe energy held in reserve, Gamma^CRM_yzt, also acts as a lower bound on the overall state of charge Gamma_yzt. This ensures      that the storage device cannot use state of charge that would not have been available had it been called on to actually contribute its      pledged virtual discharge at some earlier timestep. This relationship is described by the following constraint (as also outlined in      the storage module):\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_yzt geq Gamma^CRM_yzt quad forall y in mathcalVS^stor z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \nendaligned\n\nThe overall contribution of the co-located VRE and storage resources to the system's capacity reserve margin in timestep t is equal to      (including both actual and virtual DC and AC charge and discharge):\n\nbeginaligned\n\t sum_y in mathcalVS^pv (epsilon_yzp^CRM times eta^inverter_yz times rho^maxpv_yzt times Delta^totalpv_yz) \n     + sum_y in mathcalVS^wind (epsilon_yzp^CRM times rho^maxwind_yzt times Delta^totalwind_yz) \n     + sum_y in mathcalVS^symdc cup mathcalVS^asymdcdis (epsilon_yzp^CRM times eta^inverter_yz times (Theta^dc_yzt + Theta^CRMdc_yzt)) \n     + sum_y in mathcalVS^symac cup mathcalVS^asymacdis (epsilon_yzp^CRM times (Theta^ac_yzt + Theta^CRMac_yzt)) \n     - sum_y in mathcalVS^symdc cup mathcalVS^asymdccha (epsilon_yzp^CRM times fracPi^dc_yzt + Pi^CRMdc_yzteta^inverter_yz) \n     - sum_y in mathcalVS^symdc cup mathcalVS^asymdccha (epsilon_yzp^CRM times (Pi^ac_yzt + Pi^CRMac_yzt))\nendaligned\n\nIf long duration energy storage resources exist, a separate but similar set of variables and constraints is used to track the evolution of energy held      in reserves across representative periods, which is elaborated upon in the long_duration_storage!() function.

By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign is used for this term. Losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone. The losses function beta_lt(cdot) will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see below). Accounting for Transmission Between Zones Power flow, Phi_lt, on each line (or more likely a `path' aggregating flows across multiple parallel lines) is constrained to be less than or equal to the line's power transfer capacity, varphi^cap_l, plus any transmission capacity added on that line (for lines eligible for expansion in the set mathcalE).

The first option is to neglect losses entirely, setting the value of the losses function to zero for all lines at all hours. The second option is to assume that losses are a fixed percentage, varphi^loss_l, of the magnitude of power flow on each line, mid Phi_lt mid (e.g., losses are a linear function of power flows). Finally, the third option is to calculate losses, ell_lt, by approximating a quadratic-loss function of power flow across the line using a piecewise-linear function with total number of segments equal to the size of the set mathcalM.\n\nbeginaligned\nconfigurable losses formulation\n\t beta_lt(cdot) = begincases 0  textif textlosses0   varphi^loss_ltimes mid Phi_lt mid  textif textlosses1   ell_lt textif textlosses2 endcases quad forall l in mathcalLforall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nFor the second option, an absolute value approximation is utilized to calculate the magnitude of the power flow on each line (reflecting the fact that negative power flows for a line linking nodes i and j represents flows from node j to i and causes the same magnitude of losses as an equal power flow from i to j). This absolute value function is linearized such that the flow in the line must be equal to the subtraction of the auxiliary variable for flow in the positive direction, Phi^+_lt, and the auxiliary variable for flow in the negative direction, Phi^+_lt, of the line. Then, the magnitude of the flow is calculated as the sum of the two auxiliary variables. The sum of positive and negative directional flows are also constrained by the line flow capacity.\n\nbeginaligned\n trasmission losses simple\n\tPhi_lt =  Phi^+_lt  - Phi^-_lt quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmid Phi_lt mid =  Phi^+_lt  + Phi^-_lt quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tPhi^+_lt  + Phi^-_lt leq varphi^cap_l quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nIf discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled, ``phantom losses'' can be observed wherein the auxiliary variables for flows in both directions (Phi^+_lt and Phi^-_lt) are both increased to produce increased losses so as to avoid cycling a thermal generator and incurring start-up costs or opportunity costs related to minimum down times. This unrealistic behavior can be eliminated via inclusion of additional constraints and a set of auxiliary binary variables, ON^+_lt in 01 forall l in mathcalL. Then the following additional constraints are created:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tPhi^+_lt leq TransON^+_lt  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tPhi^-_lt leq varphi^cap_l -TransON^+_lt quad  forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere TransON^+_lt is a continuous variable, representing the product of the binary variable ON^+_lt and the expression, varphi^cap_l. This product cannot be defined explicitly, since it will lead to a bilinear expression involving two variables. Instead, we enforce this definition via the Glover's Linearization as shown below (also referred McCormick Envelopes constraints for bilinear expressions, which is exact when one of the variables is binary).\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTransON^+_lt leq  (overlinevarphi^cap_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^cap_l) times TransON^+_lt  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \n\tTransON^+_lt leq  varphi^cap_l  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \n\tTransON^+_lt geq varphi^cap_l - (overlinevarphi^cap_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^cap_l) times(1- TransON^+_lt)  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \nendaligned\n\nThese constraints permit only the positive or negative auxiliary flow variables to be non-zero at a given time period, not both. For the third option, losses are calculated as a piecewise-linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows. In order to do this, we represent the absolute value of the line flow variable by the sum of positive stepwise flow variables (mathcalS^+_mlt mathcalS^-_mlt), associated with each partition of line losses computed using the corresponding linear expressions. This can be understood as a segmentwise linear fitting (or first order approximation) of the quadratic losses function. The first constraint below computes the losses a the accumulated sum of losses for each linear stepwise segment of the approximated quadratic function, including both positive domain and negative domain segments. A second constraint ensures that the stepwise variables do not exceed the maximum size per segment. The slope and maximum size for each segment are calculated as per the method in \\cite{Zhang2013}.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t ell_lt = fracvarphi^ohm_l(varphi^volt_l)^2bigg( sum_m in mathcalM( S^+_mltimes mathcalS^+_mlt + S^-_mltimes mathcalS^-_mlt) bigg) quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \n\t textquad Where \n\t quad S^+_ml = frac2+4 times sqrt2times (m-1)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (overlinevarphi^cap_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^cap_l) quad forall m in 1 colon M l in mathcalL  \n\t quad S^-_ml = frac2+4 times sqrt2times (m-1)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (overlinevarphi^cap_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^cap_l) quad forall m in 1 colon M l in mathcalL\n\t \n\t mathcalS^+_mlt mathcalS^-_mlt = overlinemathcalS_ml quad forall m in 1M l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\t textquad Where \n\t quad overlineS_lz =  begincases frac(1+sqrt2)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1)  (overlinevarphi^cap_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^cap_l)  textif m = 1 \n\tfrac2 times sqrt2 1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (overlinevarphi^cap_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^cap_l)  textif m  1 endcases\nendaligned\n\nNext, a constraint ensures that the sum of auxiliary segment variables (m geq 1) minus the \"zero\" segment (which allows values to go into the negative domain) from both positive and negative domains must total the actual power flow across the line, and a constraint ensures that the sum of negative and positive flows do not exceed the flow capacity of the line.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tsum_m in 1M (mathcalS^+_mlt) - mathcalS^+_0lt =  Phi_lt quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tsum_m in 1M (mathcalS^-_mlt) - mathcalS^-_0lt  =  - Phi_lt\nendaligned\n\nAs with losses option 2, this segment-wise approximation of a quadratic loss function also permits 'phantom losses' to avoid cycling thermal units when discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled. In this case, the additional constraints below are also added to ensure that auxiliary segments variables do not exceed maximum value per segment and that they are filled in order; i.e., one segment cannot be non-zero unless prior segment is at its maximum value. Binary constraints deal with absolute value of power flow on each line. If the flow is positive, mathcalS^+_0lt must be zero; if flow is negative, mathcalS^+_0lt must be positive and takes on value of the full negative flow, forcing all mathcalS^+_mlt other segments (m geq 1) to be zero. Conversely, if the flow is negative, mathcalS^-_0lt must be zero; if flow is positive, mathcalS^-_0lt must be positive and takes on value of the full positive flow, forcing all mathcalS^-_mlt other segments (m geq 1) to be zero. Requiring segments to fill in sequential order and binary variables to ensure variables reflect the actual direction of power flows are both necessary to eliminate ``phantom losses'' from the solution. These constraints and binary decisions are ommited if the model is fully linear.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tmathcalS^+_mlt =    overlinemathcalS_ml times ON^+_mlt quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmathcalS^-_mlt =    overlinemathcalS_ml times ON^-_mlt  quad forall m in1M forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmathcalS^+_mlt geq ON^+_m+1lt times overlinemathcalS_ml quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmathcalS^-_mlt geq ON^-_m+1lt times overlinemathcalS_ml  quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmathcalS^+_0lt leq varphi^max_l times (1- ON^+_1lt) quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmathcalS^-_0lt leq varphi^max_l times (1- ON^-_1lt) quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Model_Reference/core/#Unit-Commitment","page":"Core","title":"Unit Commitment","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Model_Reference/core/","page":"Core","title":"Core","text":"Modules = [GenX]\nPages = [\"ucommit.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Reference/core/#GenX.ucommit!-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict, Dict}","page":"Core","title":"GenX.ucommit!","text":"ucommit!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)\n\nThis function creates decision variables and cost expressions associated with thermal plant unit commitment or start-up and shut-down decisions (cycling on/off)\n\nUnit commitment decision variables:\n\nThis function defines the following decision variables:\n\nnu_ytz\n\ndesignates the commitment state of generator cluster y in zone z at time t; chi_ytz represents number of startup decisions in cluster y in zone z at time t; zeta_ytz represents number of shutdown decisions in cluster y in zone z at time t.\n\nCost expressions:\n\nThe total cost of start-ups across all generators subject to unit commitment (y in UC) and all time periods, t is expressed as:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tC^start = sum_y in UC t in T omega_t times start_cost_yt times chi_yt\nendaligned\n\nThe sum of start-up costs is added to the objective function.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Model_Reference/core/#CO2","page":"Core","title":"CO2","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Model_Reference/core/","page":"Core","title":"Core","text":"Modules = [GenX]\nPages = [\"co2.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"Model_Reference/core/#GenX.co2!-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict}","page":"Core","title":"GenX.co2!","text":"co2!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict)\n\nThis function creates expressions to account for CO2 emissions as well as captured and sequestrated  CO2 from thermal generators.

Biomass is a factor in this equation because  biomass generators are assumed to generate zero net CO2 emissions, or negative net CO2 emissions  in the case that the CO2 they emit is captured and sequestered underground.\n\nIf a user wishes to represent a generator that combusts biomass, then in the resource .csv files, the \"Biomass\" column (boolean, 1 or 0), which represents if a generator y uses biomass or not, should be set to 1. The CO2 emissions from such a generator will be assumed to be zero without CCS and negative with CCS.\n\nThe CO2 emissions from generator y at time t are determined by total fuel  consumption (MMBTU) multiplied by the CO2 content of the fuel (tCO2/MMBTU), and by  (1 - Biomass [0 or 1] - CO2 capture fraction [a fraction, between 0 - 1]).  The CO2 capture fraction could be differernt during the steady-state and startup events (generally startup events have a lower CO2 capture fraction), so we use distinct CO2 capture fractions to determine the emissions.  In short, the CO2 emissions for a generator depend on the CO2 emission factor from fuel combustion, the CO2 capture fraction, and whether the generator uses biomass.\n\nbeginaligned\neEmissionsByPlant_gt = (1-Biomass_y-  CO2_Capture_Fraction_y) * vFuel_yt  * CO2_content + (1-Biomass_y-  CO2_Capture_Fraction_Startup_y) * eStartFuel_yt * CO2_content \nhspace1cm forall y in G forall t in T Biomass_y in 01\nendaligned\n\nWhere Biomass_y represents a binary variable (1 or 0) that determines if the generator y  uses biomass, and CO2_Capture_Fraction_y represents a fraction for CO2 capture rate.\n\nIn addition to CO2 emissions, for generators with a non-zero CO2 capture rate, we also  determine the amount of CO2 being captured and sequestered.

It also has the capability to model heat rates that are a function of load via a piecewise-linear approximation.\n\n***** Expressions ****** Users have two options to model the fuel consumption as a function of power generation:  (1). Use a constant heat rate, regardless of the minimum load or maximum load; and  (2). Use the PiecewiseFuelUsage-related parameters to model the fuel consumption via a  piecewise-linear approximation of the heat rate curves. By using this option, users can represent  the fact that most generators have a decreasing heat rate as a function of load.\n\n(1). Constant heat rate.  The fuel consumption for power generation vFuel_yt is determined by power generation  (vP_yt) mutiplied by the corresponding heat rate (Heat_Rate_y).  The fuel costs for power generation and start fuel for a plant y at time t,  denoted by eCFuelOut_yt and eFuelStart, are determined by fuel consumption (vFuel_yt  and eStartFuel) multiplied by the fuel costs ($/MMBTU) (2). Piecewise-linear approximation With this formulation, the heat rate of generators becomes a function of load. In reality this relationship takes a nonlinear form, but we model it through a piecewise-linear approximation:\n\nbeginaligned\nvFuel_yt = vP_yt * h_yx + U_gt* f_yx\nhspace1cm forall y in G forall t in T forall x in X\nendaligned\n\nWhere h_yx represents the heat rate slope for generator y in segment x [MMBTU/MWh],  f_yx represents the heat rate intercept (MMBTU) for a generator y in segment x [MMBTU], and U_yt represents the commitment status of a generator y at time t. These parameters are optional inputs to the resource .csv files.  When Unit commitment is on, if a user provides slope and intercept, the standard heat rate  (i.e., HeatRateMMBTUperMWh) will not be used. When unit commitment is off, the model will  always use the standard heat rate. The user should determine the slope and intercept parameters based on the CapSize of the plant.  For example, when a plant is operating at the full load (i.e., power output equal to the CapSize), the fuel usage determined by the effective segment divided by Cap_Size should be equal to the  heat rate at full-load.\n\nSince fuel consumption and fuel costs are postive, the optimization will force the fuel usage to be equal to the highest fuel usage segment for any given value of vP. When the power output is zero, the commitment variable U_gt will bring the intercept  to be zero such that the fuel consumption is zero when thermal units are offline.\n\nIn order to run piecewise fuel consumption module, the unit commitment must be turned on (UC = 1 or 2), and users should provide PWFUSlope* and  PWFUIntercept* for at least one segment. \n\nTo enable resources to use multiple fuels during both startup and normal operational processes, three additional variables were added:  fuel i consumption by plant y at time t (vMulFuel_yit); startup fuel consumption for single-fuel plants (vStartFuel_yt); and startup fuel consumption for multi-fuel plants (vMulStartFuel_yit).

For example, if you want to create a getter function for the attribute_1 of the NewResource type, these two ways are equivalent:julia> default_attribute_1 = 0.0    # default value for attribute_1\njulia> attribute_1(res::NewResource) = get(res, :attribute_1, default_attribute_1)\nattribute_1 (generic function with 1 method)\njulia> @interface(attribute_1, 0.0, NewResource)\nattribute_1 (generic function with 1 method)And then:julia> attribute_1(new_res1)\n6.2\njulia> new_res1.attribute_1\n6.2","category":"page"},{"location":"developer_guide/","page":"Developer Docs","title":"Developer Docs","text":"DocTestSetup = nothing","category":"page"},{"location":"developer_guide/#Utility-functions-to-work-with-JuMP-expressions-in-GenX","page":"Developer Docs","title":"Utility functions to work with JuMP expressions in GenX","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"developer_guide/","page":"Developer Docs","title":"Developer Docs","text":"Modules = [GenX]\nPages = [\"model/expression_manipulation.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"developer_guide/#GenX.add_similar_to_expression!-Union{Tuple{dim2}, Tuple{dim1}, Tuple{V}, Tuple{T}, Tuple{C}, Tuple{AbstractArray{JuMP.GenericAffExpr{C, T}, dim1}, AbstractArray{V, dim2}}} where {C, T, V, dim1, dim2}","page":"Developer Docs","title":"GenX.add_similar_to_expression!","text":"add_similar_to_expression!(expr1::AbstractArray{GenericAffExpr{C,T}, dim1}, expr2::AbstractArray{V, dim2}) where {C,T,V,dim1,dim2}\n\nAdd an array of some type V to an array of expressions, in-place.
