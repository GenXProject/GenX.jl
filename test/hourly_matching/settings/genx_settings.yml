Trans_Loss_Segments: 1 # Number of segments used in piecewise linear approximation of transmission losses; 1 = linear, >2 = piecewise quadratic
UCommit: 2 # Unit committment of thermal power plants; 0 = not active; 1 = active using integer clestering; 2 = active using linearized clustering
StorageLosses: 1 # Energy Share Requirement and CO2 constraints account for energy lost; 0 = not active (DO NOT account for energy lost); 1 = active systemwide (DO account for energy lost)
ParameterScale: 1 # Turn on parameter scaling wherein demand, capacity and power variables are defined in GW rather than MW. 0 = not active; 1 = active systemwide
