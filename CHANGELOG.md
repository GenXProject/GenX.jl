## Unreleased

### Added
- Add objective scaler for addressing problem ill-conditioning (#667)

## [0.4.0] - 2024-03-18

### Added
- Feature CO2 and fuel module (#536)
  Adds a fuel module which enables modeling of fuel usage via (1) a constant heat rate and (2)
  piecewise-linear approximation of heat rate curves.
  Adds a CO2 module that determines the CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption, CO2 capture
  fraction, and whether the feedstock is biomass.
- Enable thermal power plants to burn multiple fuels (#586)
- Feature electrolysis basic (#525)
  Adds hydrogen electrolyzer model which enables the addition of hydrogen electrolyzer
  demands along with optional clean supply constraints.
- Add ability of storage to contribute to capacity reserves (#475)
- Add Co-located VRE+Storage Module (#523)
- Add output for dual of capacity constraint (#473)
- Add PR template (#516)
- Validation ensures that resource flags (THERM, HYDRO, LDS etc) are self-consistent (#513).
- Maintenance formulation for thermal-commit plants (#556).
- Add new tests for GenX: three-zone, multi-stage, electrolyzer, VRE+storage,
  piecewise_fuel+CO2, and TDR (#563 and #578).
- Added a DC OPF method (#543) to calculate power flows across all lines
- Added write_operating_reserve_price_revenue.jl to compute annual operating reserve and regulation revenue.
  Added the operating reserve and regulation revenue to net revenue (PR # 611)
- Add functions to compute conflicting constraints when model is infeasible if supported by the solver (#624).
- New settings parameter, VirtualChargeDischargeCost to test script and VREStor example case. The PR 608 attempts to
  introduce this parameter as cost of virtual charging and discharging to avoid unusual results (#608).
- New settings parameter, StorageVirtualDischarge, to turn storage virtual charging and discharging off if desired by the user (#638).
- Add module to retrofit existing resources with new technologies (#600).
- Formatted the code and added a format check to the CI pipeline (#673).
- Add check when capital recovery period is zero and investment costs are 
  non-zero in multi-stage GenX (#666)
- Added condition number scaling added to objective function (#667)
- Added versioned doc-pages for v0.3.6 and v0.4.0

- Added a warning message in write_costs_multistage mentioning th approximate value of costs currently.

### Fixed
- Add constraint in mga to compute total capacity in each zone from a given technology type (#681)
- New settings parameter MGAAnnualGeneration to switch between different MGA formulations (#681)
- Add validation for `Can_Retire` column in multi-stage GenX since the current implementation 
  does not allow a resource to switch from can_retire = 0 to can_retire = 1 between stages. (#683)
- Add tutorials for running GenX (#637 and #685)
- Add writing of multistage stats during optimization with foresight (#687)
- Fix docstring in operational_reserves.jl (#690)
- Fix docstring in energy_share_requirement.jl (#692)
- Set MUST_RUN=1 for RealSystemExample/small_hydro plants (#517).
  Previously these plants had no resource flag set, and so they did not contribute to the power balance.
  As these plants are now useful, the objective in these cases is slightly lower.
- Assign correct investment cost per stage in objective function initialization for multi-stage runs (#530)
- Fix name of Fixed_OM_Cost_Charge_per_MWyr when reading from Generators_data in multistage code. (#533)
  Previously there was a typo in this in the multistage code that led to a silent bug, which affects outputs,
  for anyone running non-myopic multistage GenX with asymmetric storage.
- Fix computation of cumulative minimum capacity retirements in multistage GenX (#514)
- Fix access of eELOSSByZone expr before initialization (#541)
- Correctly write unmet reserves (in reg_dn.csv) (#575)
- Correctly scale total reserves column (in reg_dn.csv) (#594)
- Add validation for `Reg_Max` and `Rsv_Max` columns in `Generators_data.csv` when `MUST_RUN` is set to 1 (#576)
- Fix scaling of transmission losses in write_transmission_losses.jl (#621)
- Fix cost assignment to virtual storage charge/discharge - issue #604 (#608)
- Fix modeling of hydro reservoir with long duration storage (#572).

- Fix write_status with UCommit = WriteShadowPrices = 1 (#645)
- Fixed outputting capital recovery cost to 0 if the remaining number of years is 0 (#666)
- Updated the docstring for the initialize_cost_to_go function and adjusted the formula for the discount factor to reflect the code implementation (#672).
- Fix write_multi_stage_cost.jl: add discount with OPEX multipliers to cUnmetPolicyPenalty (#679)
- Fix DF calculation in DDP to make it more generic for variable length stages (#680)
- Fix write_power_balance.jl: add additional two columns ("VRE_Storage_Discharge" and "VRE_Storage_Charge") for VRE_STOR

### Changed
- Use add_to_expression! instead of the += and -= operators for memory performance improvements (#498).
- Generally, 'demand' is now used where (electrical) 'load' was used previously (#397).
- `Load_data.csv` is being renamed to `Demand_data.csv`.
- `Load_MW_z*` columns in that file are renamed to `Demand_MW_z*`.
- In `Reserves.csv`, `Reg_Req_Percent_Load` and `Rsv_Req_Percent_Load` are renamed to `..._Demand`.
- `Load` and `LoadWeight` keys in the `time_domain_reduction_settings.yml` file are renamed to `Demand`, `DemandWeight`.
- The `New_Build` column in `Generators_data.csv` has been separated into two: `New_Build` and `Can_Retire` (#392).
  Values in each column are {0,1}.
- Separate proprietary JuMP solvers from the GenX package.
  This allows users of Gurobi or CPLEX to use them without modifying
  the source code of the GenX package directly. This is a key step in publishing
  GenX as a proper Julia package. This does require change to the Run.jl files,
  to specify the solver. (#531)
- In the examples, change Reg_Max and Rsv_Max of any MUST_RUN generators to 0.
  This mitigates but does not fully fix (#576).
- Expressions of virtual charging and discharging costs in storage_all.jl and vre_stor.jl
- The input file `Generators_data.csv` has been split into different files, one for each type of generator.
  The new files are: `Thermal.csv`, `Hydro.csv`, `Vre.csv`, `Storage.csv`, `Flex_demand.csv`, `Must_run.csv`,
  `Electrolyzer.csv`, and `Vre_stor.csv`. The examples have been updated, and new tests have been added to
  check the new data format (#612).
- The settings parameter `Reserves` has been renamed to `OperationalReserves`, `Reserves.csv` to
  `Operational_reserves.csv`, and the `.jl` files contain the word `reserves` have been renamed to
  `operational_reserves` (#641).
- New folder structure for a GenX case. The input files are now organized in the following folders: `settings`, 
  `policies`, `resources` and `system`. The examples and tests have been updated to reflect this change. 
- New folder structure implemented for `example_system`. This folder now consists of nine separate folders each pertaining to a different case study example,
  ranging from the ISONE three zones, with singlestage, multistage, electrolyzers, all the way to the 9 bus IEEE case for running DC-OPF.
- Pruned HiGHS solver settings to the necessary minimum (#668)
- Changed deploydoc URL to GenX.jl (#662)

### Deprecated
- The above `load` keys, which generally refer to electrical demand, are being deprecated.
  Users should update their case files.
  For now this is done in a backward-compatible manner, and @info reminders are written to the log to prompt the user to update.
  "Load" now typically refers only to the transferrence of data from files to memory,
  except for a few places such as the common term "value of lost load" which refers to non-served demand (#397).
- `New_Build = -1` in `Generators_data.csv`: instead, use `New_Build = 0` and `Can_Retire = 0`.
- The matrix-style input of the grid for Network.csv is deprecated in favor a column-style input.
  Instead of columns z1, z2, ... with entries -1, 0, 1, use two columns: Start_Zone, End_Zone (#591).
