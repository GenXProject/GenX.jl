#  TIME DOMAIN REDUCTION SETTINGS
#
#  Set parameters here that organize how your full timeseries
#   data will be divided into representative period clusters.
#   Ensure that time_domain_reduction is set to 1 in GenX_settings.yml
#   before running. Run within GenX or use PreCluster.jl to test and
#   examine representative period output before proceeding.
#   Specify your data input directory as inpath within Run_test.jl
#   or PreCluster.jl.

#####

  #   - TimestepsPerRepPeriod
  #   Typically 168 timesteps (e.g., hours) per period, this designates
  #   the length of each representative period.
TimestepsPerRepPeriod: 168

  #   - ClusterMethod
  #   Either 'kmeans' or 'kmedoids', this designates the method used to cluster
  #   periods and determine each point's representative period.
ClusterMethod: 'kmeans'

  #   - ScalingMethod
  #   Either 'N' or 'S', this designates directs the module to normalize ([0,1])
  #   or standardize (mean 0, variance 1) the input data.
ScalingMethod: "S"

  #   - MaxPeriods
  #   The maximum number of periods - both clustered periods and extreme periods -
  #   that may be used to represent the input data. If IterativelyAddPeriods is on and the
  #   error threshold is never met, this will be the total number of periods.
MaxPeriods: 11

  #   - MinPeriods
  #   The minimum number of periods used to represent the input data. If using
  #   UseExtremePeriods, this must be at least the number of extreme periods requests. If
  #   IterativelyAddPeriods if off, this will be the total number of periods.
MinPeriods: 11

  #   - IterativelyAddPeriods
  #   Either 1 (yes) or 0 (no), this designates whether or not to add periods
  #   until the error threshold between input data and represented data is met or the maximum
  #   number of periods is reached.
IterativelyAddPeriods: 0

  #   - IterateMethod
  #   Either 'cluster' or 'extreme', this designates whether to add clusters to
  #   the kmeans/kmedoids method or to set aside the worst-fitting periods as a new extreme periods.
  #   The default option is 'cluster'.
IterateMethod: "cluster"

  #   - Threshold
  #   Iterative period addition will end if the period farthest (Euclidean Distance)
  #   from its representative period is within this percentage of the total possible error (for normalization)
  #   or ~95% of the total possible error (for standardization). E.g., for a threshold of 0.01,
  #   every period must be within 1% of the spread of possible error before the clustering
  #   iterations will terminate (or until the max number of periods is reached).
Threshold: 0.05

  #   - nReps
  #   The number of times to repeat each kmeans/kmedoids clustering at the same setting.
nReps: 100

  #   - DemandWeight
  #   Default 1, this is an optional multiplier on demand columns in order to prioritize
  #   better fits for demand profiles over resource capacity factor profiles.
DemandWeight: 1

  #   - WeightTotal
  #   Default 8760, the sum to which the relative weights of representative periods will be scaled.
WeightTotal: 8760

  #   - ClusterFuelPrices
  #   Either 1 (yes) or 0 (no), this indicates whether or not to use the fuel price
  #   time series in Fuels_data.csv in the clustering process. If 0, this function will still write
  #   Fuels_data_clustered.csv with reshaped fuel prices based on the number and size of the
  #   representative weeks, assuming a constant time series of fuel prices with length equal to the
  #   number of timesteps in the raw input data.
ClusterFuelPrices: 1

  #   - MultiStageConcatenate
  #   (Only considered if MultiStage = 1 in genx_settings.yml)
  #   If 1, this designates that the model should time domain reduce the input data
  #   of all model stages together. Else if 0, the model will time domain reduce each 
  #   stage separately
MultiStageConcatenate: 0

  #   - UseExtremePeriods
  #   Either 1 (yes) or 0 (no), this designates whether or not to include
  #   outliers (by performance or demand/resource extreme) as their own representative periods.
  #   This setting automatically includes the periods with maximum demand, minimum solar cf and
  #   minimum wind cf as extreme periods.
UseExtremePeriods: 1

#   - ExtremePeriods
#   Use this to define which periods to be included among the final representative periods
#   as "Extreme Periods".
#   Select by profile type: demand ("Demand"), solar PV capacity factors ("PV"), and wind capacity factors ("Wind").
#   Select whether to examine these profiles by zone ("Zone") or across the whole system ("System").
#   Select whether to look for absolute max/min at the timestep level ("Absolute")
#      or max/min sum across the period ("Integral").
#   Select whether you want the maximum ("Max") or minimum ("Min") (of the prior type) for each profile type.
