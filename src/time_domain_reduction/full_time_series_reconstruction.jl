    full_time_series_reconstruction(path::AbstractString, setup::Dict, DF::DataFrame)

Internal function for performing the reconstruction. This function returns a DataFrame with the full series reconstruction. 

# Arguments
- `path` (AbstractString): Path input to the results folder
- `setup` (Dict): Case setup
- `DF` (DataFrame): DataFrame to be reconstructed

# Returns
- `reconDF` (DataFrame): DataFrame with the full series reconstruction
