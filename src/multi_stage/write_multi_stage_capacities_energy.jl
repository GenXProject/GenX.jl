	write_multi_stage_capacities_energy(outpath::String, settings_d::Dict)

This function writes the file capacities\_energy\_multi\_stage.csv to the Results directory. This file contains starting resource energy capacities from the first model stage and end resource energy capacities for the first and all subsequent model stages.

inputs:

  * outpath â€“ String which represents the path to the Results directory.
  * settings\_d - Dictionary containing settings dictionary configured in the multi-stage settings file multi\_stage\_settings.yml.
