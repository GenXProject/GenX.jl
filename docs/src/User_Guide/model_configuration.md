# Model settings parameters

The first step in configuring a GenX model is to specify the model settings parameters. These parameters are specified in a `genx_settings.yml` file inside a `settings` folder which must be located in the current working directory. Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. In particular:
- Model structure related settings parameters affect the formulation of the model constraints and objective function. 
- Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution.
- Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. 
- Network related parameters specify settings related to transmission network expansion and losses.
Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.

(Optional) The user can also select the output files that they want to export using the `output_settings.yml` file. This file containes a list of `yes/no` options for each output file, and should be located in the `settings` folder. By default, if `output_settings.yml` is not included, GenX will export all output files. 

The following tables summarize the model settings parameters and their default/possible values.

## 1. Model structure related settings parameters

|**Parameter** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|
|UCommit | Select technical resolution of of modeling thermal generators.|

||1 = constraints account for energy lost. |
|TimeDomainReduction | 1 = Use time domain reduced inputs available in the folder with the name defined by settings parameter `TimeDomainReductionFolder`. If such a folder does not exist or it is empty, time domain reduction will reduce the input data and save the results there.|
||0 = Use the data in the main case folder; do not perform clustering.|

|VirtualChargeDischargeCost | Hypothetical cost of charging and discharging storage resources (in $/MWh).|

## 2. Solution strategy

|**Parameter** | **Description**|

||0 = Scaling is not activated. |
|MultiStage | Model multiple planning stages |
||1 = Model multiple planning stages as specified in `multi_stage_settings.yml` |

|ModelingToGenerateAlternatives | Modeling to Generate Alternative Algorithm. For details, see [here](https://genxproject.github.io/GenX/dev/additional_features/#Modeling-to-Generate-Alternatives)|
||1 = Use the algorithm. |
||0 = Do not use the algorithm. |
|ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack | value used to define the maximum deviation from the least-cost solution as a part of Modeling to Generate Alternative Algorithm. Can take any real value between 0 and 1. |
|MethodofMorris | Method of Morris algorithm |
||1 = Use the algorithm. |
||0 = Do not use the algorithm. |

## 3. Policy related

|**Parameter** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|
|CO2Cap | Flag for specifying the type of CO2 emission limit constraint.|
|| 0 = no CO2 emission limit|
|| 1 = mass-based emission limit constraint|

|| 1 = activate energy share requirement related constraints. |
|CapacityReserveMargin | Flag for Capacity Reserve Margin constraints. |
|| Default = 0 (No Capacity Reserve Margin constraints)|
|| 1 = activate Capacity Reserve Margin related constraints |
|MinCapReq | Minimum technology carve out requirement constraints.|
|| 1 = if one or more minimum technology capacity constraints are specified|
|| 0 = otherwise|
|MaxCapReq | Maximum system-wide technology capacity limit constraints.|

|| 0 = otherwise|

## 4. Network related

|**Parameter** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|

|WriteShadowPrices | Get the optimal values of dual variables of various model related constraints, including to estimate electricity prices, stored value of energy and the marginal CO2 prices.|
| WriteOutputs | Flag for writing the model outputs with hourly resolution or just the annual sum.|
|| "full" = write the model outputs with hourly resolution.|
|| "annual" = write only the annual sum of the model outputs.|
| OutputFullTimeSeries | Flag for writing the full time series of the model outputs.|
||1 = write the full time series of the model outputs.|

| OutputFullTimeSeriesFolder | Name of the folder where the full time series of the model outputs will be stored inside the results directory (default: Full_TimeSeries).|

The next step in configuring a GenX model is to specify the solver settings parameters using a `[solver_name]_settings.yml` file inside the `settings` folder. The solver settings parameters are solver specific and are described in the following section.
