# Model settings parameters

The first step in configuring a GenX model is to specify the model settings parameters. These parameters are specified in a `genx_settings.yml` file inside a `settings` folder which must be located in the current working directory. Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. In particular:
- Model structure related settings parameters affect the formulation of the model constraints and objective function. 
- Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution.
- Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. 
- Network related parameters specify settings related to transmission network expansion and losses.
Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.

(Optional) The user can also select the output files that they want to export using the `output_settings.yml` file. This file containes a list of `yes/no` options for each output file, and should be located in the `settings` folder. By default, if `output_settings.yml` is not included, GenX will export all output files. 

The following tables summarize the model settings parameters and their default/possible values.
