# GenX Outputs

The table below summarizes the units of each output variable reported as part of the various CSV files produced after each model run. The reported units are also provided. If a result file includes time-dependent values, the value will not include the hour weight in it. An annual sum ("AnnualSum") column/row will be provided whenever it is possible (e.g., `emissions.csv`).

## 2 Settings-specific outputs

This section includes the output files that GenX will print if corresponding function is specified in the Settings.

### 2.1 CapacityValue.csv

This file includes the time-dependent capacity value calculated for each generator. GenX will print this file only if the capacity reserve margin constraints are modeled through the setting file. Each row of the file (excluding the header) corresponds to a generator specified in the inputs. Each column starting from the t1 to the second last one stores the result of capacity obligation provided in each hour divided by the total capacity. Thus the number is unitless. If the capacity margin reserve is not binding for one hour, GenX will return zero. The last column specified the name of the corresponding capacity reserve constraint. Note that, if the user calculates the hour-weight-averaged capacity value for each generator using data of the binding hours, the result is what RTO/ISO call capacity credit.

<!-- #### 2.2 ExportRevenue.csv

This file includes the export revenue in $ of each zone. GenX will print this file only when a network is present and Locational Marginal Price (LMP) data is available to the GenX. The Total row includes the time-step-weighted summation of the time-dependent values shown below. For each time-step, the export revenue is calculated as the net outbound powerflow multiplied by the LMP. It is noteworthy that this export revenue is already part of the generation revenue, and the user should not double count.


#### 2.3 Importcost.csv

This file includes the import cost in $ of each zone. GenX will print this file only when a network is present and Locational Marginal Price (LMP) data is available to the GenX. The Total row includes the time-step -weighted summation of the time-dependent values shown below. For each time step, the import cost is calculated as the net inbound powerflow multiplied by the LMP. It is noteworthy that this import cost is already part of the load payment, and the user should not double count. -->

### 2.2 EnergyRevenue.csv

This file includes the energy revenue in $ earned by each generator through injecting into the grid. Only annual sum values are available.

### 2.3 ChargingCost.csv

This file includes the charging cost  in $ of earned by each generator through withdrawing from the grid. Only annual sum values are available.

### 2.4 ReserveMargin.csv

This file includes the shadow prices of the capacity reserve margin constraints. GenX will print this file only when capacity reserve margin is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver, as described earlier. Each row (except the header) corresponds to a capacity reserve margin constraint, and each column corresponds to an time step. As a reminder, GenX models the capacity reserve margin (aka capacity market) at the time-dependent level, and each constraint either stands for an overall market or a locality constraint.

### 2.5 ReserveMarginRevenue.csv

This file includes the capacity revenue earned by each generator listed in the input file. GenX will print this file only when capacity reserve margin is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Each row corresponds to a generator, and each column starting from the 6th to the second last is the total revenue from each capacity reserve margin constraint. The revenue is calculated as the capacity contribution of each time steps multiplied by the shadow price, and then the sum is taken over all modeled time steps. The last column is the total revenue received from all capacity reserve margin constraints. As a reminder, GenX models the capacity reserve margin (aka capacity market) at the time-dependent level, and each constraint either stands for an overall market or a locality constraint.

### 2.6 ESR\_prices.csv

This file includes the renewable/clean energy credit price of each modeled RPS/CES constraint. GenX will print this file only when RPS/CES is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. The unit is $/MWh.

### 2.7 ESR\_Revenue.csv

This file includes the renewable/clean credit revenue earned by each generator listed in the input file. GenX will print this file only when RPS/CES is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Each row corresponds to a generator, and each column starting from the 6th to the second last is the total revenue earned from each RPS constraint. The revenue is calculated as the total annual generation (if elgible for the corresponding constraint) multiplied by the RPS/CES price. The last column is the total revenue received from all constraint. The unit is $.

### 2.8 SubsidyRevenue.csv

This file includes subsidy revenue earned if a generator specified Min\_Cap is provided in the input file. GenX will print this file only the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Do not confuse this with the Minimum Capacity Carveout constraint, which is for a subset of generators, and a separate revenue term will be calculated in other files. The unit is $.

## 3 Output file names and type

As of GenX v0.4.2, the names of all results files can be changed by including the file `results_settings.yml`. Inclusion of this file is not necessary; the default names described above will be used if the file is not present. 

Files are automatically saved as `.csv` in GenX. To change this, you can 1) change the extension of a file name in `results_settings.yml` (e.g. set `demand: "Demand.json"`), or 2) use `ResultsFileType` in `genx_settings.yml` to change the type of all the files. File names in `results_settings.yml` with preexisting extensions will override the type in `ResultsFileType`. For example, if `ResultsFileType = .csv`, but in `results_settings.yml` you have `demand: "Demand.json"`, the demand file will be saved as JSON, and all others will be saved as CSV. No error will be thrown. 

Files can also be saved with gzip, snappy, and zstd compression. To choose which files are compressed, add the compression to the extension in `results_settings.yml` (e.g. set `demand: "Demand-snappy.parquet"` or `fuels: "Fuels.csv.gz"`). To compress all files, specify the `ResultsCompressionType` in `genx_settings.yml`. If the compression type is specified in settings, it does not need to be present in the results names. The correct file extension will be appended to the filename. If the file type and compression type conflict (e.g. CSV with snappy compression), no compression will be used.

For an example, see `1_three_zones/settings`.

Both single and multistage results files are in the same file. The file `results_settings.yml` has the following structure:
