# GenX Inputs

All input files are in CSV format. Running the GenX model requires a minimum of four **mandatory input files** and one folder, which consists of CSV files for generating resources:

1. Fuels\_data.csv: specify fuel type, CO2 emissions intensity, and time-series of fuel prices.
2. Network.csv: specify network topology, transmission fixed costs, capacity and loss parameters.
3. Demand\_data.csv: specify time-series of demand profiles for each model zone, weights for each time step, demand shedding costs, and optional time domain reduction parameters.
4. Generators\_variability.csv: specify time-series of capacity factor/availability for each resource.
5. Resources folder: specify cost and performance data for generation, storage and demand flexibility resources.
 
Additionally, the user may need to specify eight more **settings-specific** input files based on model configuration and type of scenarios of interest:
1. Operational\_reserves.csv: specify operational reserve requirements as a function of demand and renewables generation and penalty for not meeting these requirements.
2. Energy\_share\_requirement.csv: specify regional renewable portfolio standard and clean energy standard style policies requiring minimum energy generation from qualifying resources.
3. CO2\_cap.csv: specify regional CO2 emission limits.
4. Capacity\_reserve\_margin.csv: specify regional capacity reserve margin requirements.
5. Minimum\_capacity\_requirement.csv: specify regional minimum technology capacity deployment requirements.
6. Vre\_and\_stor\_data.csv: specify cost and performance data for co-located VRE and storage resources.
7. Vre\_and\_stor\_solar\_variability.csv: specify time-series of capacity factor/availability for each solar PV resource that exists for every co-located VRE and storage resource (in DC terms).
8. Vre\_and\_stor\_wind\_variability.csv: specify time-series of capacity factor/availability for each wind resource that exists for every co-located VRE and storage resource (in AC terms).
9. Hydrogen\_demand.csv: specify regional hydrogen production requirements.

## 1 Mandatory input data


### 1.1 Fuels\_data.csv

• **First row:** names of all fuels used in the model instance which should match the labels used in `Fuel` column in one of the resource `.csv` file in the `resources` folder. For renewable resources or other resources that do not consume a fuel, the name of the fuel is `None`.

• **Second row:** The second row specifies the CO2 emissions intensity of each fuel in tons/MMBtu (million British thermal units). Note that by convention, tons correspond to metric tonnes and not short tons (although as long as the user is internally consistent in their application of units, either can be used).

• **Remaining rows:** Rest of the rows in this input file specify the time-series for prices for each fuel in $/MMBtu. A constant price can be specified by entering the same value for all hours.

* ** First column:** The first column in this file denotes, Time\_index, represents the index of time steps in a model instance.


### 1.2 Network.csv

This input file contains input parameters related to: 1) definition of model zones (regions between which transmission flows are explicitly modeled) and 2) definition of transmission network topology, existing capacity, losses and reinforcement costs. The following table describe each of the mandatory parameter inputs need to be specified to run an instance of the model, along with comments for the model configurations when they are needed.

###### Table 3: Structure of the Network.csv file
---
|**Column Name** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|
|**Settings-specific Columns**|
|**Multiple zone model**||
|Network\_Lines | Numerical index for each network line. The length of this column is counted but the actual values are not used.|
| z* (Network map) **OR** Start_Zone, End_Zone | See below |
|Line\_Max\_Flow\_MW | Existing capacity of the inter-regional transmission line.|
|**NetworkExpansion = 1**||
|Line\_Max\_Reinforcement\_MW |Maximum allowable capacity addition to the existing transmission line.|
|Line\_Reinforcement\_Cost\_per\_MWyr | Cost of adding new capacity to the inter-regional transmission line.|
|**Trans\_Loss\_Segments = 1**||
|Line\_Loss\_Percentage | fractional transmission loss for each transmission line||
|**Trans\_Loss\_Segments > 1**||
|Ohms | Line resistance in Ohms (used to calculate I^2R losses)|
|kV | Line voltage in kV (used to calculate I^2R losses)|
|**CapacityReserveMargin > 0**||
|CapRes\_* | Eligibility of the transmission line for adding firm capacity to the capacity reserve margin constraint. * represents the number of the capacity reserve margin constraint.|
||1 = the transmission line is eligible for adding firm capacity to the region|
||0 = the transmission line is not eligible for adding firm capacity to the region|
|DerateCapRes\_* | (0,1) value represents the derating of the firm transmission capacity for the capacity reserve margin constraint.|
|CapResExcl\_* | (-1,1,0) = -1 if the designated direction of the transmission line is inbound to locational deliverability area (LDA) modeled by the capacity reserve margin constraint. = 1 if the designated direction of the transmission line is outbound from the LDA modeled by the capacity reserve margin constraint. Zero otherwise.|
|**MultiStage == 1**|
|Capital\_Recovery\_Period  |Capital recovery period (in years) used for determining overnight capital costs from annualized investment costs for network transmission line expansion.  |
|Line\_Max\_Flow\_Possible\_MW  |Maximum possible line flow in the current model period. Overrides Line\_Max\_Reinforcement\_MW, which is not used when performing multi-stage modeling.  |

There are two interfaces implemented for specifying the network topology itself: a matrix interface and a list interface.
Only one choice is permitted in a given file.

The list interface consists of a column for the lines start zone and one for the line's end zone.
Here is a snippet of the Network.csv file for a map with three zones and two lines:
```
Network_Lines, Start_Zone, End_Zone,
            1,          1,        2,
            2,          1,        3,
```

The matrix interface requires N columns labeled `z1, z2, z3 ... zN`,
and L rows, one for each network line (or interregional path), with a `1` in the column corresponding to the 'start' zone 
and a `-1` in the column corresponding to the 'end' zone for each line.
Here is the same network map implemented as a matrix:
```
Network_Lines, z1, z2, z3,
            1,  1, -1,  0,
            2,  1,  0, -1,
```

Note that in either case, positive flows indicate flow from start to end zone;
negative flows indicate flow from end to start zone.


### 1.3 Demand\_data.csv (Load\_data.csv)

This file includes parameters to characterize model temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations, electricity demand for each time step for each zone, and cost of load shedding. Note that GenX is designed to model hourly time steps. With some care and effort, finer (e.g. 15 minute) or courser (e.g. 2 hour) time steps can be modeled so long as all time-related parameters are scaled appropriately (e.g. time period weights, heat rates, ramp rates and minimum up and down times for generators, variable costs, etc).

|Timesteps\_per\_Rep\_Period |Number of timesteps per representative period (e.g. 168 if period is set as a week using hour-long time steps). This is always a single entry: all representative periods have the same length. For a full-year model, this entry is equal to the number of time steps.|
|Sub\_Weights |Number of annual time steps (e.g. hours) represented by each timestep in a representative period. The length of this column is equal to the number of representative periods. The sum of the elements should be equal to the total number of time steps in a model time horizon (e.g. 8760 hours if modeling 365 days or 8736 if modeling 52 weeks).|

| :------------ | :-----------|
|Num\_VRE\_bins | Number of resource availability profiles considered for each VRE resource per zone. This parameter is used to decide the number of capacity investment decision variables related to a single variable renewable energy technology in each zone.|
||Num\_VRE\_bins = 1: using a single resource availability profile per technology per zone. 1 capacity investment decision variable and 1 generator RID tracking technology power output (and in each zone).|
||Num\_VRE\_bins > 1: using multiple resource availability profiles per technology per zone. Num\_VRE\_bins capacity investment decision variables and 1 generator RID used to define technology power output at each time step (and in each zone). Example: Suppose we are modeling 3 bins of wind profiles for each zone. Then include 3 rows with wind resource names as Wind\_1, Wind\_2, and Wind\_3 and a corresponding increasing sequence of RIDs. Set Num\_VRE\_bins for the generator with smallest RID, Wind\_1, to be 3 and set Num\_VRE\_bins for the other rows corresponding to Wind\_2 and Wind\_3, to be zero. By setting Num\_VRE\_bins for Wind\_2 and Wind\_3, the model eliminates the power outputs variables for these generators. The power output from the technology across all bins is reported in the power output variable for the first generator. This allows for multiple bins without significantly increasing number of model variables (adding each bin only adds one new capacity variable and no operational variables). See documentation for `curtailable_variable_renewable()` for more. |

#### 1.5 Generator\_variability.csv

This file contains the time-series of capacity factors / availability of each resource included in the resource `.csv` file in the `resources` folder for each time step (e.g. hour) modeled.

1) First column: The first column contains the time index of each row (starting in the second row) from 1 to N.
2) Second column onwards: Resources are listed from the second column onward with headers matching each resource name in the resource `.csv` file in the   `resources` folder in any order. The availability for each resource at each time step is defined as a fraction of installed capacity and should be between 0 and 1. Note that for this reason, resource names specified in the resource `.csv` file must be unique. Note that for Hydro reservoir resources (i.e. `Hydro.csv`), values in this file correspond to inflows (in MWhs) to the hydro reservoir as a fraction of installed power capacity, rather than hourly capacity factor. Note that for co-located VRE and storage resources, solar PV and wind resource profiles should not be located in this file but rather in separate variability files (these variabilities can be in the `Generators_variability.csv` if time domain reduction functionalities will be utilized because the time domain reduction functionalities will separate the files after the clustering is completed).

### 2.2 Energy\_share\_requirement.csv

This file contains inputs specifying minimum energy share requirement policies, such as Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) or Clean Energy Standard (CES) policies. This file is needed if parameter EnergyShareRequirement has a non-zero value in the YAML file `genx_settings.yml`.

Note: this file should use the same region name as specified in the the resource `.csv` file (inside the `Resource`).

###### Table 19: Structure of the Energy\_share\_requirement.csv file

| :------------ | :-----------|
|Zone| zone number|
|Hydrogen_Demand_kt| Hydrogen production requirements for zone *, in 1,000 tons|


!!! note "Notes"
    1. Upper and lower bounds are specified in terms of percentage deviation from the nominal value.
    2. Percentage variation for uncertain parameters in a given group is identical. For example, if solar cluster 1 and solar cluster 2 both belong to the ‘solar’ group, their Lower_bound and Upper_bound must be identical
    3. P\_steps should at least be = 1\%, i.e., Upper\_bound – Lower\_bound $<$ p\_steps
    4. P\_steps for parameters in one group must be identical
    5. Total\_num\_trajectory should be around 3 to 4 times the total number of uncertain parameters
    6. num\_trajectory should be approximately equal to the total number of uncertain parameters
    7. len\_design_mat should be 1.5 to 2 times the total number of uncertain parameters
    8. Higher number of num\_trajectory and len_design_mat would lead to higher accuracy
    9. Upper and lower bounds should be specified for all the resources included in the resource `.csv` file (inside the `Resource`). If a parameter related to a particular resource is not uncertain, specify upper bound = lower bound = 0.
